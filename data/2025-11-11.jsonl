A strong demand for characterizing TDs has driven the development of\nmany imaging techniques, such as multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MPPL)\nmicroscopy and spontaneous Raman microscopy. However, all these techniques lack\nthe capability of visualizing densely existing TDs in a non-destructive and\nthree-dimensional (3D) way or distinguishing the types of TDs. Here, we propose\nmultimodal 3D stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and MPPL microscopy to\nnon-destructively characterize the TDs in free-standing GaN substrates.\nLeveraging strong SRS signals, we achieve an imaging speed 10^2-10^3 times\nfaster than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy. This acceleration of the\nimaging speed enables 3D SRS imaging of the strain fields that are induced by\nTDs and correlated with the edge components of the Burgers vectors. Multimodal\n3D SRS and MPPL imaging reveals rich information on TD features and behavior,\nincluding propagation directions, Burgers vectors, dislocation reactions, and\ntheir relationships. Furthermore, we present a deterministic identification\nmethod for screw-type TDs, which are regarded as killer defects causing leakage\ncurrent in p-n junctions, by exploiting no SRS peak shifts at screw\ndislocations in combination with MPPL patterns. Our multimodal imaging\ntechnique will greatly advance the understanding of dislocations toward\nrealizing high-quality GaN crystals and high-performance GaN devices."}

Here p type\nBi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and n type Bi2Te2.97Se0.03 are used as the constituent materials\nfor an NPN transistor. By applying forward bias to the emitter and reverse bias\nto the collector to form a common-base triode configuration, the thermoelectric\neffect, transistor effect, and interfacial effects within the NPN\nheterostructure are coupled. This NPN heterostructure induces temperature\nincrease (heat release) at the forward biased end and temperature decrease\n(heat absorption) at the reverse biased end. Therefore, this device becomes a\nnew type of thermoelectric transistor cooler. Furthermore, a DC equivalent\ncircuit method is introduced to analyze the cooling performance of the\nthermoelectric transistor cooler. The results show that when the emitter\nvoltage of the NPN thermoelectric transistor cooler is 0.01925V, the collector\nvoltage is 0.2124V, the corresponding base region width is 0.17nm, the maximum\ntemperature difference of 242.89K can be obtained.

However, its spatial resolution is fundamentally restricted to the\nmicrometer scale by the optical diffraction limit. Tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG)\nusing a scanning tunneling microscope has been developed to overcome this\nlimitation. The acquired spectra exhibit characteristic dips originating from\nvibrational responses located within the strong broadband non-resonant\nbackground (NRB), which distorts and obscures the molecular signals. By making\nthe second pulse temporally asymmetric and introducing a controlled delay\nbetween the first and second laser pulses, the NRB was effectively suppressed,\nwhich in turn amplified the vibrational response through interference and\nfacilitated the detection of weak vibrational signals. This interference also\nmade the technique phase-sensitive, enabling the determination of absolute\nmolecular orientations. Furthermore, forward- and backward-scattered signals\nwere simultaneously detected, conclusively confirming that the observed signals\noriginated from tip enhancement rather than far-field contributions. Finally,\nthe signal enhancement factor in TE-SFG was estimated to be $6.3\\times\n10^6-1.3\\times 10^7$, based on the experimental data.
