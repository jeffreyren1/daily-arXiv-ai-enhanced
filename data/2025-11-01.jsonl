Focused ion beam\ntechnology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring\noptoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the\ntarget region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the\ncritical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D\nTMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric\nencapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage,\nleading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned\nmicrostructures.

Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct\npatterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion\nimplantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding\nultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This\ncombined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers\na robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for\nintegrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby\nmaintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing\nquantum technologies and compact optical circuits."}
