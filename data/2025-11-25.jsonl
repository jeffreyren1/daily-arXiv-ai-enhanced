By adding an amorphous Si (a-Si) buffer to the n-InN/p-Si structure, we have improved the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices while maintaining their material quality. We have firstly optimized the deposition of Si on Si(100) by DC sputtering, obtaining an amorphous material with bandgap energy of 1.39 eV. Then we have studied the influence of the thickness of the a-Si buffer layer (0-25 nm) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of InN nanowires on Si (100) substrates. With the use of a 15-nm buffer, n-InN/a-Si/p-Si nanowire heterojunction solar cells exhibit a promising short-circuit current density of 17 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 0.37 V and fill factor of 35.5%, pointing to a power-conversion efficiency of 2.3% under 1-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. These work demonstrated that the combination of in-situ sputtered a-Si, which could serve as potential passivation layer, and the light trapping enhancement by the nanostructured active layer leads to an improvement of the photovoltaic efficiency of sputtered III-nitride devices."}

In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management. This work establishes NF-LC-based TENGs as a new platform for high-performance self-powered energy harvesting, linking soft matter physics with applied energy technology."}

An equivalent circuit model was developed to accurately fit both finite-element-simulated and measured admittance spectra, enabling reliable parameter extraction.

Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band (λ~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of λ~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications."}

Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)."}

Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits."}

We have experimentally validated this concept, successfully performing simultaneous spectroscopic imaging of a sample and quantitative wavefront characterization of the illumination, thereby accurately quantifying the chromatic aberration of a broadband field. This capability establishes AP-CDI as a highly efficient and versatile tool for real-time, multi-modal imaging, with immediate potential in ultrafast science, material characterization, and live-cell bio-imaging."}

Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field. This provides a consistent, metric-based elucidation for the intrinsic limitations of concentration in passive metamaterials and extreme-index platforms."}

We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles."}

When processes occur on sub-picosecond timescales, time-resolved methods such as transient absorption, up-conversion, and optical Kerr gating (OKG) can be utilized to probe these dynamics, though they are typically applied to ensembles rather than single emitters. The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs. BBS glass was selected for its high nonlinear coefficient, which enhances detection efficiency, sub-ps response time, and its compatibility with standard microscopy platforms."}
