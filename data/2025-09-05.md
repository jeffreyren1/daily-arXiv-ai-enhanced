<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机是为了在光电倍增管中抑制暗电流，同时找到在保持对特定波长敏感性的基础上最大化带隙和最小化新缺陷的方法。

Method: 采用了一系列基于电容的测量技术，包括深能级光电容谱、稳态光电容和光照电容-电压测量，对轻n型AlInGaP吸收区域的缺陷进行了表征。

Result: 研究发现了多个深能级缺陷，包括一个接近中带隙的缺陷。结果表明，铝的加入会使陷阱密度增加约10倍，但空穴捕获截面似乎减小，这可能有助于抑制Shockley-Read-Hall暗电流。

Conclusion: AlInGaP材料可能适合发展为硅光电倍增管的类似物，其较宽的带隙使其在闪烁体应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Characterizing intrinsic defects is an important step in evaluating materials
for new optoelectronic device applications. For photomultipliers, suppressing
dark currents is critical, but there exists a tradeoff between maximizing the
band gap while remaining sensitive to the wavelength of interest, and
minimizing the incorporation of new defects by growing not-yet-optimized
alloys. We present a series of capacitance-based measurements, including deep
level optical spectroscopy, steady-state photocapacitance and illuminated
capacitance-voltage, on photodiodes with lightly \textit{n}-type
Al$_x$In$_y$Ga$_{1-x-y}$P absorber regions. Several deep levels are identified,
including one near midgap. While the inclusion of aluminum increases each trap
density by approximately 10x, the hole capture cross section also appears to
decrease, suggesting that Shockley-Read-Hall dark currents may be suppressed.
These materials may be good candidates for development into silicon
photomultiplier analogs with wider bandgap for scintillator applications.

### [2] [Sensitivity of excitonic transitions to temperature in monolayers of TMD alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03209)

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 该论文研究了二维过渡金属二硫化物（TMDs）合金的光学和电子性质，通过合金化实现带隙能量和激子跃迁的连续调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二维TMDs因其可调的光学和电子性质在下一代光电器件中具有广阔应用前景。合金化是一种有效的调控手段，但对其温度依赖性和激子跃迁行为的系统性研究尚不充分，需要通过实验探索。

Method: 作者采用温度依赖性透射光谱技术，在20-320 K的温度范围内，对Mo1-xWxS2和Mo(S1-xSex)2合金单层进行了测试。实验采用了全光纤配置，以提高稳定性和精确度。

Result: 研究发现，Se含量的增加导致激子跃迁红移，而W替代Mo导致蓝移。此外，Se的掺入增强了非单调的温度响应，而W替代则导致更强的单调温度依赖性。A和B跃迁的分裂也随成分变化而变化。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过成分调控可以实现对二维TMD合金光谱和热学性质的精确控制，为设计可调谐且稳定的光电器件提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer tunable optical
and electronic properties, making them highly promising for next-generation
optoelectronic devices. One effective approach to engineering these properties
is through alloying, which enables continuous control over the bandgap energy
and excitonic transitions. In this study, we perform temperature-dependent
transmission spectroscopy on monolayers of Mo1-xWxS2 and Mo(S1-xSex)2 alloys,
transferred onto the core of an optical fiber and measured within a cryostat
over a temperature range of 20-320 K. The use of an all-fiber configuration
allowed us to probe interband transitions A, B, and C with high stability and
precision. We observe a systematic redshift of excitonic transitions with
increasing Se content, and a blueshift when Mo is replaced with W. These
spectral shifts correlate with alloy composition and enable the tuning of
bandgap energies between 1.6 eV and 2.0 eV at room temperature. Furthermore, we
analyze the temperature sensitivity of the excitonic transitions, revealing
that Se incorporation enhances thermal response in a non-monotonic manner,
while W substitution results in a more monotonic and stronger temperature
dependence. The splitting between A and B transitions, associated with
spin-orbit coupling, also varies with composition. Our findings underscore the
potential of compositional engineering in 2D TMD alloys to achieve both
spectral and thermal control of optical properties, relevant for the design of
robust and tunable optoelectronic systems.

### [3] [Shake-Table Tests of a Three-Storey Steel Structure with Resilient Slip-Friction Joints (RSFJ)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03452)
*Nicholas Chan,Ashkan Hashemi,Soheil Assadi,Pierre Quenneville,Charles Clifton,Gregory MacRae,Rajesh Dhakal,Liang-Jiu Jia*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 本文通过振动台试验评估了三种采用Resilient Slip-Friction Joint (RSFJ)的结构配置在地震作用下的表现，包括仅受拉支撑（TOB）、受拉受压支撑（TCB）和抗弯框架（MRF）。结果显示，这些结构在地震后能够自复位，且峰值位移在设计范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震工程领域需要评估和展示不同结构概念在地震作用下的韧性。本文的目标是通过实验验证RSFJ技术在多种结构配置中的有效性，尤其是在地震后自复位和减震方面的性能。

Method: 作者对三种结构配置（TOB、TCB和MRF）进行了振动台试验，模拟El Centro地震动，逐步增加强度直至峰值加速度达到0.5 g。测试包括单向和双向地震作用，记录峰值位移、层间位移和加速度等参数。

Result: 所有结构在地震后均表现出良好的自复位能力，残余位移仅0.03%。峰值位移和层间位移均在设计范围内，最高分别为1.26%和1.62%。双向测试中，扭转效应导致最大加速度达到0.95 g，但对位移影响较小。

Conclusion: RSFJ技术在地震条件下表现出优异的减震和自复位能力，适用于多种结构配置。双向地震作用中的扭转问题需进一步研究，但整体性能验证了该技术的有效性和韧性。

Abstract: Shake-table tests were conducted as part of the Robust Building Systems
(ROBUST) program to evaluate and demonstrate the resilience of various
structural concepts under earthquake excitations. This paper presents the
results of 3 different configurations incorporating the Resilient Slip-Friction
Joint (RSFJ) in: (1) tension-only braces (TOB), (2) tension-compression braces
(TCB), and (3) moment-resisting frame (MRF) joints along the longitudinal
direction. Each building configuration was subjected to the El Centro ground
motion at increasing intensities, reaching a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of
about 0.5 g. The peak displacements sustained were well within design values,
with the top floor deflecting by 0.66%, 0.98% and 1.26% of the total height for
the TOB, TCB and MRF systems respectively. The corresponding inter-storey
drifts peaked at 0.87%, 1.11% and 1.62%. In all cases, the structures
essentially self-centered with residual drifts limited to 0.03%. The floor
accelerations observed in unidirectional tests were 0.67 g (TOB), 0.66 g (TCB)
and 0.62 g (MRF). The spikes may occur during (a) direction reversal at peak
Mode 1 amplitude, (b) under the influence of higher Mode 2, and/or (c)
stiffness transition at the upright/plumb position. In bidirectional tests,
torsion effects contributed to the largest acceleration recorded at 0.95 g
(TCB). Unbalanced resistance/deformation of symmetric friction connections in
the transverse direction led to the structure twisting and loading the
longitudinal RSFJs unevenly. However, the effects on peak displacements were
not significant and similar responses as unidirectional tests indicate
effective performance under simultaneous out-of-plane shaking. The results
demonstrate the RSFJ's ability to damp seismically induced vibrations and
restore structures to their original, undeformed shape after earthquakes.

Abstract: A novel method to generate vector vortex THz beams with angular momentum by a
pair of pumps was reported. The helicity of the vector THz beam, that from
polarization to orbital angular momentum can be finely tuned by manipulating
the pulse delay between two pump pulses and a S-waveplate. All the states of
THz vector vortices on the higher-order Poincar\'e sphere are able to be
generated. The synthesis was theoretically explored and experimentally
verified. This approach paves the way to the sources of versatile structured
THz beams and may benefit the potential applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The synergy between metasurfaces and non-volatile phase change materials
(PCMs) has created many reconfigurable photonic devices for applications in
optical memory, optical computing and optical communications. But these
advances have been limited to the infrared wavelengths due to the high loss of
PCMs in the visible regime. Here we demonstrate a nonvolatile visible
metasurface that is electrically reconfigurable using wide bandgap PCM Sb2S3.
Our device supports a resonant mode at 610 nm, a wavelength largely
under-explored for PCM-based metasurfaces. By incorporating only a 20 nm thick
layer of Sb2S3, we experimentally demonstrate a resonance tuning range of 16
nm. Reversible switching of the metasurface is accomplished in situ using a
carefully engineered, ultrathin doped silicon micro-heater. Our work paves the
way for integrating PCMs into visible-frequency systems, particularly for
human-centric applications such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

Abstract: OpenCAL is a low cost CAL based printing and post processing platform
developed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components and standard rapid
prototyping tools. The system incorporates recent advancements in VAM,
including Optical Scattering Tomography (OST), and is designed with modularity
to support future technological integration. The post processing systems
developed include standardized procedures for solvent based removal of uncured
resin and a centrifugal cleaning module for enhanced material recovery.
  To support the continued advancement of this technology, multiple community
engagement pathways have been established to foster the collaborative
development of the OpenCAL ecosystem. A primary deployment environment for
OpenCAL is academic makerspaces, where the system is specifically designed to
leverage the rapid prototyping tools typically available in these facilities.
OpenCAL not only introduces advanced volumetric additive manufacturing
capabilities to makerspaces but also serves as a platform for hands on
education in emerging manufacturing technologies, photopolymer science, and
computational imaging. By lowering the barriers to entry for volumetric
printing research, OpenCAL enables a broader range of students, from
undergraduate to graduate levels, to engage directly in experimental research,
contribute to the refinement of open source CAL technologies, and participate
in interdisciplinary projects spanning materials science, mechanical
engineering, and computer science. In doing so, OpenCAL has the potential to
significantly expand the technical capabilities of academic makerspaces,
transforming them into hubs for next generation manufacturing innovation and
research driven learning.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits route and shape light on a chip, but
back-reflections feed back into coherent on-chip lasers, destabilizing
operation and corrupting signals. Robust operation requires an integrated
optical isolator that strongly suppresses backward propagation while
maintaining low-loss, broadband forward transmission. However, prior on-chip
isolators rely on magneto-optic materials or resonance-based filters, which
respectively demand non-standard processes or inherently constrain bandwidth.
Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a traveling-wave optical
isolator without magnetic materials or resonant elements. By driving four
parallel optical channels with periodic RF waves, we realize dynamic rotating
destructive interference that continuously cancels backward-propagating light
while leaving forward-propagating light unaffected. We achieve about 30 dB
isolation at a wavelength of 789.7 nm and maintain over 24 dB isolation across
an approximately 30 nm bandwidth (770 nm to 800 nm), including >20 dB isolation
for two simultaneous lasers within an approximately 10 nm wavelength window.
This wavelength span covers key alkali atomic transitions, enabling strong
suppression of feedback-induced frequency noise and laser instability in atomic
spectroscopy, laser cooling, and locking applications. We demonstrate a
practical, broadband on-chip isolator applicable from the visible to the
near-infrared, which is a crucial step toward fully integrated photonic
platforms.

Abstract: Light sources based on high-harmonic generation (HHG) underpin ultrafast

high-harmonic generation into account and is therefore applicable across the
broad range of parameters that HHG based light sources are today utilized in.
The program is validated by calculating harmonic emission in four common

Abstract: To reach and maintain high contrast levels, coronagraph instruments will
require a combination of low-order and high-order wavefront control techniques
to correct for dynamic wavefront error. Efficient low-order wavefront sensing
and control (LOWFSC) schemes use the starlight rejected by the coronagraph such
that LOWFSC can operate with a relatively bright signal to correct rapid
disturbances. Meanwhile, a family of high-order wavefront sensing and control
(HOWFSC) techniques utilizing the science camera have been developed to create
regions of high contrast known as dark holes. These two control loops must
operate simultaneously for dark holes to be maintained over long observation
periods. Using a 952 actuator MEMS deformable mirror and a vector vortex
coronagraph (VVC) on the Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB), we
demonstrate a Lyot-based LOWFSC loop operating in combination with a HOWFSC
loop. For these experiments, implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) is the
chosen HOWFSC technique, and we demonstrate how this empirical method can be
calibrated and deployed while the LOWFSC loop corrects for dynamic wavefront
error. We show this combination of LOWFSC and iEFC maintained 1E-8 contrast
levels in air.

Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing.
This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes
and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser
manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter,
particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing.
This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of
analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical
pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via
reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific
nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques
(where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by
the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the
transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the
arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on
microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in
laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and
shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases,
shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring,
etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes
for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk
of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography,
tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter
provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological
developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the
requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite the promising optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide
(MAPbI3)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their commercial viability is
hindered by interfacial energy misalignment, suboptimal light absorption, and
thermal instability. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to
enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through
integrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address
interfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL
junction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising
CuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level
alignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations,
combining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite
element method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that
optimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the
CuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However,
planar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability,
exhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures
attain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity,
underscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent
limitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell
(HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the
full device stack. This design enhances broadband light trapping and optical
confinement throughout the active layers while maintaining fabrication
feasibility through geometrically realistic structuring.

Abstract: Metasurfaces facilitate high-capacity optical information integration by
simultaneously supporting near-field nanoprinting and far-field holography on a
single platform. However, conventional multi-channel designs face critical
security vulnerabilities for sensitive information due to insufficient
encryption mechanisms. In this work, we propose a four-channel phase-change
metasurface featuring algorithm-physical co-security-a dual-protection
framework combining intrinsic metasurface physical security with chaotic
encryption. Our polarization-multiplexed metasurface generates four optical
imaging channels through meta-atom design, including two far-field holograms
and two near-field patterns. To enhance system security, we apply Chen
hyperchaotic encryption combined with the Logistic map and DNA encoding to
convert near-field information into secure QR codes; far-field holograms are
retained to demonstrate the metasurface's information capacity and for attack
detection. Phase-change metasurface further provides physical-layer security by
dynamically switching imaging channels via crystalline-to-amorphous state
transitions, enhancing anti-counterfeiting and reliability. The proposed
metasurface achieves high-fidelity imaging, robust anti-attack performance, and
independent channel control. This integrated approach pioneers a secure
paradigm for high-density optical information processing.

Abstract: Complex band structures describe resonant modes in periodic systems finite in

The imaginary frequency component, $\omega''$, tied to quality factors, is
often probed through numerical or phenomenological models, limiting deeper
insights. Here, we introduce a first-principles framework deriving complex band
structures from scattering matrix poles, integrated with perturbation theory to

include a two-band model yielding $\omega'' = C(\mathbf{k}_{||})\delta^2$ and
identifying accidental bound states in the continuum (BICs) at
$C(\mathbf{k}_{||})=0$, with dual Fabry--P\'erot modes from impedance
degeneracy; a three-band model reveals Friedrich--Wintgen and
symmetry-protected BICs plus linewidth behaviors; inclusion of orthogonal
polarizations characterizes far-field states and exceptional points; and the
above model can be extended to two-dimensional systems. This unified approach
advances light confinement studies, including nano-photonics and
interdisciplinary wave physics with broad implications for high-performance
optical devices.

Abstract: Optoelectronic systems based on multiple modes of light can often exceed the
performance of their single-mode counterparts. However, multimode nonlinear
interactions often introduce considerable amounts of noise, limiting the
ultimate performance of these systems. It is therefore crucial to develop ways
to simultaneously control complex nonlinear interactions while also gaining
control over their noise. Here, we show that noise buildup in nonlinear
multimode systems can be strongly suppressed by controlling the input
wavefront. We demonstrate this approach in a multimode fiber by using an active
wavefront-shaping protocol to focus a region of high intensity - yet low
intensity noise - at the output. Our programmable control of both the input and
output reduces the beam noise by 12 dB beyond what linear attenuation achieves,
reaching levels near the quantum shot-noise limit. We show that this is
possible because the optimally shaped wavefront maximally decouples the output
intensity fluctuations from the input laser fluctuations. These findings are
supported by a new theoretical and simulation framework that efficiently
captures spatiotemporal quantum noise dynamics in highly multimode nonlinear
systems. Our results highlight the potential of programmable wavefront shaping
to enable nonlinear multimode technologies that overcome noise buildup to
operate at quantum-noise limits.
