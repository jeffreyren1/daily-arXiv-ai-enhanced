While these technologies promise similar\nimprovements in long-range imaging applications, macroscale light-based SA\nimaging is significantly more challenging. In this work, we first demonstrate\nthat speckle noise is particularly problematic for light-based SA systems.\nSpecifically, we prove that it is fundamentally impossible to perform SA\nimaging of fully diffuse scenes if one captures sequential measurements that\nsuffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. We then develop a snapshot SA\nimaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that can overcome\nthis limitation and enable SA imaging. Remarkably, we further demonstrate, in\nsimulation, that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency\ninformation in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures.\nThat is, one can use speckle to improve the resolution of an SA imaging system."}
