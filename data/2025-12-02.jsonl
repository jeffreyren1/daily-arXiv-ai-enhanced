However, there are currently limited methods suitable for broadly disseminating the sub-picosecond timing signals or performing frequency comparison of these clocks--particularly over open-air paths. Established microwave time transfer techniques only offer nanosecond level time synchronization, whereas optical techniques have challenging pointing requirements and lack the capability of all-weather operation. In this paper, we explore optically derived millimeter-wave carriers as a time-frequency link for full utilization of the next generation of portable optical clocks. We introduce an architecture that synthesizes 90 GHz millimeter waves with a one second residual instability of 2x10^-15, averaging into the 10^-17 range. In addition, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind 110 m phase-stabilized free-space frequency comparison link over a millimeter-wave band with a one second instability in the 10^-14 region. Technical and systematic uncertainties are investigated and characterized, providing a foundation for future time and frequency transfer experiments among distributed portable optical clocks."}

We introduce SIMFormer, a fully blind SIM reconstruction framework that learns a powerful, data-driven prior directly from raw images via self-supervision. This learned prior regularizes the solution and enables reliable extrapolation beyond the optical transfer function cutoff, yielding an effective resolution of approximately 45~nm. We validate SIMFormer on synthetic data and the BioSR dataset, where it resolves features such as flattened endoplasmic reticulum lipid bilayers previously reported to require STORM-level resolution. A self-distilled variant, SIMFormer+, further improves noise robustness while preserving high resolution at extremely low photon counts. These results show that learned priors can substantially extend SIM resolution and robustness, enabling rapid, large-scale imaging with STORM-level detail."}

However, achieving tunable nonlinearity at terahertz (THz) frequencies faces significant challenges due to the lack of materials that combine high nonlinear responses with strong sensitivity to external stimuli in this spectral regime. Here, we show giant modulation of THz nonlinearity by optically tailoring the valley degree of freedom in semiconductor-based metasurfaces. Mediated by the resonant behaviors of metasurfaces, photoexcited electrons transition into different valleys in the conduction band in response to the driving THz field, with the transition rate controlled by light intensity. Since THz nonlinearities vary significantly with electron dynamics in different valleys, various nonlinear effects-such as nonlinear transmission and generation-can be efficiently enhanced and modulated within a single metasurface using weak optical pumping. With optical energy as low as a few picojoules, we achieve on-off switching of THz third harmonic generation with a modulation depth exceeding 20000%, along with effective tunability of its nonperturbative behaviors. Our approach breaks new ground in active THz devices fully compatible with semiconductor industry standards, indicating a promising building block for ultrafast THz signal processing, all-optical computing, and nonlinear optical elements."}

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones).

In this work, we demonstrate a compact and polarization-invariant photonic metasurface, fabricated from hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) and based on radial bound states in the continuum (BIC), which are formed by radially distributed pairs of structurally asymmetric resonators. The metasurface employs multiple symmetry-breaking perturbations to support high quality-(Q-)factor resonances within a footprint smaller than 8 x 8 $μm^2$ - one-sixth of the area of previous approaches. Compared to established hBN metasurface designs, the radial geometry furthermore achieves significantly higher Q-factors with a reduced footprint.

However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs). Here, we present a compact and high-throughput imaging-based SEIRA platform that combines broadband gradient metasurfaces with a radiofrequency-modulated QCL that generates remarkably broad instantaneous emission spectrum (250 cm$^{-1}$) covering absorption bands of multiple distinct molecular vibrational modes. By matching the resonance spectrum of the compact (1 mm$^2$) broadband gradient metasurface with the laser emission projected on its surface through a dispersive element, we ensure that every QCL spectral component is uniquely addressed for an efficient targeted enhancement of the electromagnetic field. This enables us to use a low-cost and room-temperature mid-IR camera, acquiring in a single frame the enhanced absorption signatures of analytes deposited on the metasurface as a barcode image, thus reducing the acquisition time by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the FTIR and EC QCL based measurements.

Furthermore, our scheme can also be combined with physics-prior-based reconstruction algorithms, enabling high-quality imaging under undersampled conditions. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for imaging through dynamic scattering media, which can be extended to other imaging systems."}

The white shark optimizer has excellent global search capabilities. However, its calculation is cumbersome, programming complex and inefficient. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the white shark optimizer, it is improved by using the Tent map, introducing the dynamic nonlinear time factor, setting the automatic termination condition and adding the three-step search method. The improved white shark optimizer is applied to the integer-pixel displacement search. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sub-pixel displacement calculation, an improved surface fitting method is proposed by combining bicubic interpolation, improved white shark optimizer and surface fitting method. Through grayscale interpolation, the distance between the fitting points is reduced, and the accuracy of search of the surface fitting method is further improved. The performance of the improved white shark optimizer and the improved surface fitting method is tested by simulated speckle pattern. Test results revealed that the computational efficiency of the improved white shark optimizer is comparable to that of the particle swarm optimization, and the search success rate is as high as 100%. The calculation accuracy of the improved surface fitting method is comparable to that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm, but the computational efficiency is much higher than that of the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Finally, the tensile experiment of low-carbon steel is used to verify the feasibility of the improved surface fitting method in actual measurement."}

Traditional approaches struggle to overcome the parasitic limitations arising from fabricating those components using different processes. Here, we report a novel 3D heterogeneously integrated optical receiver based on micro-transfer printing (μTP), enabling the co-integration of a compact bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) electronic chiplet (0.06 mm2) directly onto a silicon photonic integrated circuit (SiPIC). While previous μTP demonstrations have focused primarily on photonic integration, our work pioneers the direct integration of electronics and photonics, significantly enhancing performance and scalability. The resulting optical receiver achieves 224 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) operation, delivering -5.2 dBm optical modulation amplitude(OMA) sensitivity at a bit-error rate (BER) of 2.4 x 10-4, a record-small footprint, and an excellent power efficiency of 0.51 pJ/b. This demonstration not only showcases the potential of μTP for high-density, cost-efficient integration but also represents a critical step toward next-generation optical interconnects in the AI era."}

Importantly, the underlying physics processes determining device performance are today fully understood, and dedicated engineering projects are currently advancing these sources towards real-world quantum technology applications. We review the performance of deterministic single-photon sources based on quantum dots in photonic crystal waveguides, the approach with the highest performance specs since it intrinsically combines suppression of leaky modes and Purcell enhancement to slow-light waveguide mode.

However, deviations between the anticipated target structure and the actual print often occur due to physico-chemical processes, limiting the accuracy and reliability of this technology. To minimize these deviations, we hereby present our latest research in developing different neural networks, targeting the above-mentioned aspect. Our networks are trained on several experimental as well as theoretical datasets and show good results in predicting fabrication deviations and (pre-) correcting 2.5D micro-structures. Hence, we demonstrate, that besides conventional iterative correction methods, neural networks are a promising alternative to significantly improving the output quality in DLW. Furthermore, there are no fundamental limitations to transferring this machine learning approach to other 3D printing technologies, as they all face the same challenge in terms of fidelity. To our point of view, the use of neural networks has the potential to enhance the capabilities of this technology, enabling the creation of complex structures with increased accuracy and precision in the near future."}

An additional mirror reflector, together with the mirror surface of the sample, forms a double mirror located between the pole pieces of a powerful laboratory electromagnet. The presence of an additional mirror leads to mixing of the amplitude ($ΔR/R$) and phase ($Δφ$) RMCD-components in the amplitudes of the signals at the first and second harmonics of the phase modulation. It is shown that the RMCD spectroscopy technique using a simplified scheme and an additional mirror requires the synchronous measurement of three electrical signals proportional to the amplitudes of the corresponding terms in the expression for the total intensity of monochromatic radiation detected by the photodetector: a constant signal $V_{dc}$ and high-frequency amplitudes $V_f$ and $V_{2f}$ at phase modulation frequencies $f$ and $2f$. The ratios $V_f/V_{dc}$ and $V_2f/Vdc$ determine a system of linear equations for $ΔR/R$ and $Δφ$ with known ellipsometric parameters $\\tanΨ$ and $Δ$ of the additional mirror, which are found either from additional measurements using an ellipsometer or directly (in sity) using the RMCD spectrometer itself."}

The COF-SA satisfies the free-energy criterion for bistability, enabling switching among non-lasing, continuous-wave, and mode-locking states. Two optical bistability regions are observed, including a distinctive direct mode-locking to non-lasing transition during pump down-sweep, absent in previous EDFL studies. Stable soliton-like pulses and stepwise pulse-number hysteresis further indicate first-order phase-transition-like dynamics. These results show that low-saturation intensity SAs offer a compact route to bistability-assisted pulse formation in fiber lasers."}

By imposing an edge-zero condition on the incident field, we derive compact closed-form Fresnel expressions written solely in terms of standard Fresnel integrals. The framework generalizes straightforwardly to an arbitrary number of incident plane-wave components, enabling intuitive control of the transmitted angular spectrum through interference engineered at the aperture. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the closed-form model and characterize the influence of slit geometry, wavelength, partial coherence, and Gaussian beam width. We also discuss experimental feasibility and highlight potential applications in apodization, structured illumination, beam shaping, and multiplexed sensing. Overall, the results show that multi-wave coherent illumination provides a simple and tunable route to tailoring diffraction patterns and generating propagation-robust field profiles."}

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems."}

An important concept in this context is the Generalized Wigner-Smith (GWS) matrix, which has previously been primarily studied for optimizing radiation forces and torques on single objects embedded inside complex scattering environments. Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media."}
