Hall", "Samuel Alperin"], "title": "Canonical Clocks and Hidden Geometric Freedom in Self-Imaging", "comment": null, "summary": "Self-imaging represents a core hallmark of paraxial (quadratic)-wave evolution; yet, across its many realizations and generalizations over the past two centuries, the uniformity of recurrence planes along the propagation axis has been considered fundamental. However, by reframing the general phenomenon of self-imaging within its natural symplectic framework, we show that all self-imaging effects are necessarily tied to uniformly periodic recurrences in the canonical evolution coordinate -- metaplectic time -- and that the correspondence of that coordinate to the physical propagation axis represents an unexplored degree of freedom, which can be engineered arbitrarily by the initial transverse phase structure. Using a single programmable spatial light modulator, we demonstrate the construction of Talbot carpets characterized by recurrence spacings that accelerate and decelerate along the propagation axis, as well as those that follow polynomial, exponential, and sinusoidal axial trajectories, all of which preserve exact reconstruction in the canonical metaplectic time. These results establish metaplectic time as the fundamental invariant of self-imaging and reveal a regime of controllable axial dynamics previously thought to be fixed."}

Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring. The integration of electromagnetic tagging with machine learning enables scalable and efficient drone identification, paving the way for enhanced aerial traffic management and security in increasingly congested airspaces."}

In response, ultrasonic testing (UT) has shown promise for non-invasive assessment due to its ease of use and sensitivity to mechanical changes which are correlated with electrochemical changes within the battery. We summarize the research in UT methods applied to LIBs throughout their life-cycle and the relevant techniques at each stage.

Yet, direct observation of rotational dynamics at the single-molecule level in liquids remains challenging due to the trade-off between optical detectability and hydrodynamic responsiveness. Labels that are bright enough for rapid readout typically introduce excessive drag, while minimally perturbing probes are difficult to detect at high speed. This limits access to fast rotational dynamics required for direct torque measurements. Here, we introduce cylindrical-polarization-based interferometric scattering microscopy (cypiSCAT), a method encoding the orientation of anisotropic scatterers directly into a single interferometric point spread function, while intrinsically suppressing the isotropic background. We achieve rotational tracking of low-drag orientation labels based on DNA origami-attached gold nanorods with sub-degree angular precision and microsecond temporal resolution, allowing quantitative characterization of nanoscale rotational dynamics. This capability provides direct access to torque metrology at the single-molecule level, here demonstrated through the extraction of optically induced torques as small as ~1 pN nm. Relying on elastic scattering, cypiSCAT combines ultrafast temporal resolution with long observation times, making it well-suited for capturing rapid and rare rotational events and reaction steps in nanoscale biomolecular systems."}

The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels. The proposed design delivers strong low-frequency conversion and sustains broadband half-power operation, while parametric studies confirm that the performance is tunable and robust over a wide range of slit angles and widths."}

This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud.

The conversion is quantified by the ratio between the reflected shear-wave energy and the incident compressional-wave energy, obtained from mode decomposition and energy-flux evaluation below the surface. The results indicate that the inclined geometry introduces strong coupling between normal and tangential motions at the boundary, enabling suppression of the ordinary compressional reflection while redirecting the reflected energy into the shear channel. This simple, geometry-controlled mechanism provides a compact route for low-frequency elastic-wave polarization control."}

The enhancement of optical properties at various resonances and the tunability of the hybridized modes are discussed. Importantly, our study reveals that despite the system being perfectly inversion-symmetric and achiral, it exhibits circular polarization anisotropy effects for non-zero finite azimuthal angles, manifested in the off-block-diagonal elements of the constructed Mueller matrices. The origin of this intriguing circular anisotropy effect is unravelled using the sequential linear birefringence and linear diattenuation effects arising from geometrical polarization transformation.

This makes them prospective for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum devices.

In this article, we present a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current understanding of excitonic properties in single-layer TMDs, integrating results from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and other experimental techniques with first-principles theoretical insights. Special emphasis is placed on the comparison and reconciliation of discrepancies observed across different experimental setups and sample qualities. Furthermore, we highlight our state-of-the-art GW-BSE calculations, which include both equilibrium and laterally strained systems, to systematically analyse the behaviour of direct and indirect excitons. By evaluating the effect of strain as a tunable control variable, we demonstrate its potential to engineer excitonic properties, supported by cross-validation against prior theoretical predictions and experimental findings.

These effective qubits are dynamical superposition states formed during laser-driven sub-cycle electron motion and appear in diverse settings, including short-long trajectories in high-harmonic generation (HHG), early-late ionization bursts in multicolor fields, polarization-selective recombination channels, and momentum or energy-bin interference in above-threshold ionization (ATI). Attosecond qubits can be prepared, coherently manipulated, and read out using existing attosecond techniques, providing a compact Hilbert-space description of strong-field dynamics beyond semiclassical trajectory pictures. A density-matrix formulation makes explicit the roles of coherence, dephasing, and decoherence, arising from continuum propagation, Coulomb interaction, infrared dressing, and macroscopic averaging, within a reduced description that remains far from thermalization. The attosecond qubits framework identifies new opportunities for ultrafast coherence metrology and for probing open quantum dynamics in strongly driven, time-dependent Hamiltonians."}
