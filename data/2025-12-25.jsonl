However, scaling their power and energy while preserving complex phase and spatial structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we demonstrate coherent beam combining as a versatile and scalable method for generating high-power structured beams without limitations on topological charge or spatial structure, while maintaining exceptionally high modal purity. We experimentally implement coherent beam combining for optical vortex beams with topological charges l = 1, 5, and 8, achieving a combined average power of 100 W and a peak power of 100 kW, with combining efficiencies of 95.0%, 93.9%, and 91.2%, respectively. Off-axis digital holography confirms that the phase and intensity profiles of the combined beams retain high modal purity, even at high topological charges. These results establish coherent beam combining as an effective route to high modal purity structured light at high power levels, unlocking new opportunities for advanced photonics and high-intensity light-matter interaction studies."}

Piezopolymer-based transducers offer a practical alternative; however, most existing studies focus on piezoelectric materials, while the influence of electrode material and electrode-polymer interface remains underexplored. This study leverages different interface-engineering strategies to examine the influence of electrode-piezopolymer interface morphology on piezoelectric, dielectric, and acoustic behavior in flexible transducers. Devices were fabricated using silver (Ag), gold (Au), graphene flakes (GF), laser-induced graphene (LIG), and Au-decorated LIG electrodes, enabling comparison across interfacial architectures. LIG-based transducers showed strong acoustic and piezoelectric output due to partial infiltration of the piezopolymer into the porous LIG network, which enhances interfacial contact and stress transfer. Au-based transducers achieved comparable acoustic output. In contrast, dense Ag electrodes and layered GF films provided limited coupling, resulting in reduced electromechanical response. LIG-based transducers exhibited the highest flexibility and durability, retaining stable performance after 10,000 bending cycles and an eight-week aging study, whereas GF, Ag, and Au devices degraded under bending, and Ag electrodes declined over time. These findings demonstrate that engineering the electrode-polymer interface is critical for high-performance flexible ultrasound transducers and identify LIG as a strong candidate for wearable imaging applications."}

These bound states are resonant states of the electromagnetic field with a complex resonance frequency and can have very small mode volumes. PCCs are attractive for a variety of applications, from cavity quantum electrodynamics to biosensing. A PC slab geometry is advantageous given its superior manufacturability compared to three-dimensional crystals, and the accessibility of the surface allows sensing and coupling. However, the emission into the half spaces above and below the slab limits the bound state lifetime. Controlling this emission is thus crucial for applications, most of which benefiting from a long lifetime. A range of methods to find defect geometries suppressing the emission to increase the lifetime have been demonstrated in the past. However, they do not cater for a designed resonant frequency covering a wide addressable range, as needed for multiplexed devices. Here, we demonstrate a design method controlling both resonance frequency and emission, by minimising a cost function including both losses and target frequency. We show applications on PCCs in GaAs PC slabs immersed in water, relevant for biosensing. The reduced refractive index contrast in these structures compared to previously studied PCCs embedded in vacuum renders the emission suppression more challenging. We optimize the quality factor of a standard L3 cavity from 1000 to 10^4-10^5, with an addressable resonance frequency range covering 12% relative bandwidth, spanning more than half of the band gap. We furthermore report optimised structures of H1 cavities, and provide the optimisation code for widespread use."}

In this work, we consider an elastic compliant plate coupled to a two-dimensional foundation comprising an array of bistable elements, a system that can form and retain complex continuous morphologies without sustained actuation via creation of stable domain walls separating regions in different stable states. These domain walls exhibit three distinct behaviors: expansion, shrinking, and metastable pinning. These arise from two limits of foundation discreteness. In the continuum limit, where bistable units are strongly coupled, domain walls undergo global phase transitions analogous to first-order phase transitions. In the anti-continuum limit, discreteness introduces Peierls-Nabarro-type energy modulations that lead to metastable pinning. To quantify these behaviors and the transition between the two limits, we develop a reduced-order model that captures the total potential energy of configurations with domain walls and validate it using finite element analysis (FEA). For axisymmetric domain walls, the model yields phase diagrams identifying the regimes of expansion, shrinking, and pinning as functions of bistable-potential asymmetry, relative foundation discreteness, and domain-wall size. We then extend the analysis to non-axisymmetric geometries and establish local geometric criteria that predict the stability of convex and concave polygonal domain walls, confirmed by simulations. Together, these results clarify how discreteness enables stability through energy-landscape modulation, provide predictive design rules for multistable reconfigurable surfaces, and offer insights into domain-wall stability more generally in elastically coupled multistable metamaterials."}

Here, we introduce a MHz-frequency ultrasonic metamaterial based on laser-engraved glass. By structuring meta-voxels with different engraving patterns, we define a fully-3D, anisotropic metamaterial exhibiting local variations in the sound speed of up to 20% compared to unstructured glass, and losses 100x lower than in comparable 3D printed metamaterials. We use this metamaterial to define a library of standard elements that can be modularly combined to create and shape complex-patterned ultrasonic fields.

Designing metaplatforms to enhance chiroptical signals under linearly polarized excitation is particularly appealing due to the minimal chiral background and the ease of controlling excitation polarization. Here, a novel two-step inverse design scheme for dielectric lossless metasurfaces with superchiral hot spots is proposed. The method extends the local density of field enhancements for non-chiral fields into the chiral regime and significantly surpasses previous enhancements in super-chiral field generation. It has been demonstrated that by leveraging the excitation of high quality factor modes with small mode volumes, it is theoretically possible to convert linearly polarized plane waves into a superchiral hot spot with record-high enhancement in the near-field optical chirality up to 104. A prototype is successfully implemented using advanced nanofabrication technologies. The optical characterization of the prototype demonstrates a 102-fold enhancement in optical chirality. The findings of this study unveil novel prospects for chiral spectroscopy with ultra-compact devices, underscoring the role of machine learning and physics-based inverse design in the development of cutting-edge, functional photonic structures."}

Analytic continuation of this dispersion relation to $ν= -1$ yields a formal zero-frequency endpoint where $j_{-1}(x) = \\cos x / x$ admits the root $x = 0$. We examine this limit in detail, showing that while the mathematics is well-defined, the endpoint does not correspond to a physical electromagnetic mode. The positivity of the angular Sturm-Liouville operator restricts physical eigenvalues to $ν\\geq 0$, placing $ν= -1$ outside the admissible spectrum. We demonstrate that all electromagnetic field components vanish in this limit, even though the underlying Debye potential $Π= \\cos(kr)/kr$ remains non-trivial and exhibits a monopole-type singularity at the origin. This distinction between potential and field reflects the kernel structure of the curl-curl operator for spherically symmetric configurations.

Using numerical solutions to the 2D excitonic Schrodinger equation, we quantify the resulting confinement through binding energies, wavefunction profiles, and a spatial confinement parameter. These results offer a practical and scalable route for integrating 2D-based quantum emitters into photonic platforms, paving the way for next-generation quantum optoelectronic devices."}

Here, we present a scalable and reconfigurable silicon photonic integrated circuit capable of emulating arbitrary non-Hermitian time evolution with high precision. Using this programmable platform, we implement a two-band non-Hermitian Hamiltonian defined on a Klein-bottle topology a nonorientable parameter space that enables exceptional phases forbidden on orientable manifolds. Through an on-chip amplitude-and-phase reconstruction protocol, we retrieve the full complex Hamiltonian at multiple points in parameter space and experimentally map the associated Fermi arc where the imaginary eigenvalue gap closes. The orientation of the measured Fermi arc reveals a nontrivial exceptional topology: it implies the presence of same-charge EPs (or an EP monopole) that cannot annihilate locally on the Klein bottle. Our results demonstrate the first photonic realization of exceptional topology on a nonorientable manifold and establish a versatile platform for exploring exotic non-Hermitian and topological models relevant to classical and quantum photonics."}

Includes Supplementary Materials", "summary": "Reconstructive spectrometers are a promising emerging class of devices that combine complex light scattering with inference to enable compact, high-resolution spectrometry. Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers."}

Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing."}

Their exceptional stability and strong resistance to atmospheric turbulence make them a compelling alternative to conventional Gaussian and other structured beams for free-space optical systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the physical principles, generation strategies, experimental realizations, and emerging applications of OPBs. By precise spatial modulation of the optical wave vectors, OPBs achieve highly collimated, self-reconstructing propagation with distinctive pin-like features that confer remarkable robustness and self-healing capability. We further discuss several OPB derivatives--including vortex, inverted, and vortex-inverted OPBs--which expand the functional landscape by enabling flexible control over amplitude, phase, polarization, and orbital angular momentum. Experimentally, OPBs have demonstrated outstanding performance across diverse platforms, ranging from free-space and underwater optical communications to optical trapping and super-resolution imaging. With their unique combination of propagation stability, light-field tunability, and environmental adaptability, OPBs hold strong promise for next-generation optical communication, precision sensing, and advanced imaging technologies.

In this work, we introduce a convolutional photonic accelerator that employs programmable kernels manifesting as trainable waveforms in the frequency domain to enable low-energy, high-throughput scalable image classification. The proposed scheme inherently provides dimensionality reduction and feature extraction directly in the optical domain. Numerical results targeting the Fashion-MNIST show that by using only 16 optical nodes, the system's classification accuracy tops at 90.1% when typical backpropagation is used. Moreover, by adapting the training technique to the forward-forward approach, a marginal drop of 1% is recorded compared to the backpropagation scenario, thus showcasing the compatibility of the overall architecture with a hardware-friendly training approach. Finally, we experimentally implement the trained kernels using a programmable waveshaper. Despite the difference between the simulated and experimentally generated transfer functions of the programmable kernels, the classification accuracy based on the experimentally obtained kernels exhibits a marginal 0.2% reduction, proving the validity of the idea and its high robustness to variations of the frequency-applied complex weights."}
