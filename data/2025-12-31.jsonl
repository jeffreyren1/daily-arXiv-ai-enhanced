These discretizations are constructed using a one-dimensional map, $φ_{n+1}=F(φ_{n})$, which provides a direct and systematic algorithm for generating such models. Numerical computations for two representative cases show that the discrete kinks do not possess internal modes, consistent with the continuum theory, although an additional high-frequency mode may appear above the phonon band. We also show that generic discretizations of the $φ^{6}$ model do not support static kink solutions. Instead, the resulting dynamics produce auto-traveling and self-accelerating kinks that propagate at the maximal group velocity while continuously emitting radiation."}

The software implements a hybrid computational strategy that couples Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization with a symplectic Størmer-Verlet temporal integrator, ensuring both exponential spatial convergence for smooth solutions and long-term preservation of Hamiltonian structure. To optimize performance, the solver incorporates adaptive timestepping based on Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria and utilizes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for parallelized force computation. The library's capabilities are validated across four canonical physical regimes: dispersive linear wave propagation, static topological kink preservation in phi-fourth theory, integrable breather dynamics in the sine-Gordon model, and non-integrable kink-antikink collisions. Beyond standard numerical validation, this work establishes a multi-faceted analysis framework employing information-theoretic entropy metrics (Shannon, Rényi, and Tsallis), kernel density estimation, and phase space reconstruction to quantify the distinct phenomenological signatures of these regimes. Statistical hypothesis testing confirms that these scenarios represent statistically distinguishable dynamical populations. Benchmarks on standard workstation hardware demonstrate that the implementation achieves high computational efficiency, making it a viable platform for exploratory research and education in nonlinear field theory."}

We then perform a very useful reduction of the Whitham modulation system to gain a system of initial-value problems whose solutions can provide important insights on edge features of the DSWs such as their edge speeds. In addition, we also study the numerical rarefaction waves (RWs) of the lattice based on the two quasi-continuum models.

Emerging dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) confront the conventional approach of extracting such a model from a numerical simulation with multiple challenges. First, the cost of accurately simulating an intricate and electrically large DMA architecture might be prohibitive. Second, the model-reality mismatch due to fabrication inaccuracies might be substantial, especially at higher frequencies and for DMA architectures leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) to maximize their tunability. These considerations motivate an experimental parameter estimation for DMA forward models. The main challenge lies in the forward model's non-linearity due to inter-element MC. Multiport network theory (MNT) can accurately capture MC but the MC parameters cannot be measured directly. In this article, we demonstrate the experimental estimation of a high-accuracy proxy MNT model for a 19-GHz DMA with 7 feeds and 96 elements, where all feeds and elements are strongly coupled via a chaotic cavity. For a given DMA configuration and excitation, our proxy MNT model predicts the reflected field at the feeds and the radiated field with accuracies of 40.3 dB and 37.7 dB, respectively. A simpler, MC-unaware benchmark model only achieves 2.6 dB and 3.3 dB, respectively. We systematically examine the influence of the number of feeds and measured DMA configurations on the model accuracy, motivating the inclusion of \"auxiliary calibration feeds\" to facilitate the parameter estimation when the intended DMA operation is limited to a single feed. Finally, we measure DMA configurations optimized based on our proxy MNT model."}

The measurement is intrinsically self-referenced, as the dispersion-induced phase is extracted from the interference between counter-propagating nonlinear processes within the same Sagnac loop, eliminating the need for an external reference arm or prior calibration. Operating entirely at telecom wavelengths and read out on a standard optical spectrum analyzer, the device produces instantaneous, high-visibility fringes and calibration-free spectra using dual-port normalization. We demonstrate chromatic dispersion measurements on fiber samples ranging from 25 cm to 4 km, spanning short fiber segments to long-haul links.

We present a comprehensive investigation of power amplification in these structures, where a spatially periodic refractive index profile is modulated in time at frequencies near the Bragg condition. Through systematic numerical simulations, we explore the impact of modulation location (high-index vs. low-index layers), modulation frequency relative to the Bragg frequency, and modulation amplitude on the gain spectrum and field dynamics. We demonstrate that both high-index and low-index layer modulations can produce significant parametric amplification, with high-index modulation yielding higher gain for comparable modulation depths. The amplification is frequency-agile, with gain peaks tunable across a broad spectral range, and exhibits strong asymmetry between sub-Bragg and supra-Bragg regimes, the former requires substantially stronger modulation for comparable gain. In the extreme sub-Bragg limit, the system transitions from discrete sideband amplification to a broadband gain continuum at high frequencies, explained by multi-phase-matching of parametric processes.

Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data.

However, visual comfort and accurate performance evaluation remain challenging due to the complex interaction between pixel luminance, human visual perception, and measurement artifacts. In this work, we introduce a novel 2D imaging luminance meter that replicates key optical parameters of the human eye, including entrance pupil size and angular resolution, to assess perceived pixel luminance. We report comprehensive measurements across various visual field angles and distances and establish a refined luminance metric that aligns with foveal vision standards (1/120 degree). Furthermore, a new method to quantify and mitigate stray light effects significantly improves measurement precision by reducing luminance overestimation from 7\\% to 2\\%. Our findings provide a foundation for optimizing LED display design for perceptual comfort and advancing standardization in pixel luminance evaluation."}

However, how to enhance the efficiency in the artificial light-harvesting systems is still unclear. In this paper, we investigate the energy-transfer process in the photosystem I (PSI). When there is no effective coupling between the outer antenna (OA) and the reaction center (RC), the two light-harvesting networks are disconnected and thus the energy transfer is inefficient. In order to repair these disconnected networks, we introduce a bridge with three sites between them. We find that by modulating the level structure of the 3-site bridge to be resonant, the energy transfer via the dark state will be enhanced and even outperform the original PSI. Our discoveries may shed light on the designing mechanism of artificial light-harvesting systems."}

We quantified modulation effects under a CMOS-compatible bias at 1 MHz frequency, achieving a variation of 5% in the Stokes parameters and a variation of the polarization ellipse angles of about 3° for the transmitted light. These results demonstrate that dynamic polarization and phase modulation can be attained in a compact platform, highlighting the potential of high-Q resonant LiNbO3 metasurfaces for enhanced light-matter interaction in subwavelength electro-optic devices."}

Here we develop a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC), which sets an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square value of nonadiabaticity factor. We further introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion, which minimizes spatial inhomogeneity and allows us to safely increase the mean nonadiabaticity. Experimentally, we implement this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves >0.95 fidelity over a fivefold reduced device length compared to the conventional scheme, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with the system size, and maintains robust performance across a >400 nm bandwidth. This principle of GAC provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across quantum and classical topological platforms."}

The availability of precisely defined structured light at the extremity of an exceedingly narrow and flexible cable holds the potential to stimulate a diverse range of highly sought-after applications, encompassing rapid communication, quantum computing, and, notably, imaging. What we lack in reaching these aspirations is the resilience of such light transport to deformations of the waveguide. Although recent theoretical investigations have delineated the attributes of ideal multimode fibres capable of deformation-enduring conveyance of structured light, tangible fibres possessing this indispensable trait to a practical extent remain elusive. Our study takes a deep dive into the precision of commercially available multimode fibres with the highest probability of demonstrating the phenomenon. We identified minuscule imperfections in their refractive index distribution, examined how these affect light transport when the fibre is deformed, and studied their implications for imaging applications. Our investigation has confirmed that these imperfections are indeed responsible for the undesirable alterations introduced into the output structured light fields during bending. Finally, as an alternative to standard graded-index fibres, manufactured by drawing silica-based preforms, we present narrow multimode waveguides in which the refractive-index profile has been established by ion exchange. These waveguides indeed exhibit previously unseen resilience of structured light transport even under severe deformation conditions and aptly fulfil the requirements of imaging applications."}

Introduces Fisher information as an operational metric for structured optical beams", "summary": "Structured optical beams possess rich spatial features that are commonly characterized using entropic measures of field complexity. However, such measures do not directly quantify the operational usefulness of optical structure for parameter estimation and sensing. Here we introduce Fisher information as an operational metric to assess the metrological content of structured optical fields. By treating the measured intensity distribution as a statistical object, we define Fisher information with respect to physically relevant parameters, such as transverse displacement. We demonstrate that optical modes with comparable Shannon entropy can exhibit markedly different Fisher information, revealing sensitivity features associated with nodal structure and local curvature. Using Hermite--Gaussian modes as minimal test cases, we show that increasing modal order systematically enhances Fisher information. We then extend the analysis to two widely used families in structured light: Laguerre--Gaussian vortex beams and finite-energy Bessel--Gauss beams. Across these representative families, Fisher information provides a unified and experimentally accessible criterion for comparing structured optical fields in sensing applications."}

Machine-learning-assisted optimization pipelines have recently emerged as efficient tools to accelerate this process, yet their performance strongly depends on the choice of neural-network (NN) architecture. In this work, we integrate the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm into an established deep-learning optimization framework for dielectric chiral metasurfaces. NEAT autonomously evolves both network topology and connection weights, enabling task-specific architectures without manual tuning, whereas the reinforcement-learning strategy in our framework evolves knowledge of the solution space and fine-tunes a model's weights in parallel. Using a pipeline-produced dataset of 9,600 simulated GaP metasurface geometries, we evaluate NEAT under varying input dimensionalities, feature-scaling methods, and data sizes. With standardized feature scaling yielding the most consistent performance for both examined output dimensionalities, the relatively compact NEAT-evolved NN models, when integrated into the full optimization pipeline, achieve similar or improved predictive accuracy and generalization compared to initially employed dense few-layer perceptrons. Accordingly, these resource-efficient models successfully perform inference of metasurfaces exhibiting strong circular dichroism in the visible spectrum, allowing for transfer learning between simulated and experimental data. This approach demonstrates a scalable path toward adaptive, self-configuring machine-learning frameworks for automated photonic design both standalone and as building block for agentic artificial intelligence (AI)."}

While phase-change materials (PCMs) provide large refractive index modulation, widely used materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) have been successfully deployed in commercial applications including optical data storage. However, they exhibit significant optical absorption in their crystalline state, which poses a challenge for transmissive photonic devices such as PTIs where high transparency is essential. Here, we overcome this fundamental limitation by integrating the ultra-low-loss PCM antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) onto a silicon-based 2D PTI. We achieve submicron-scale selective patterning of Sb2Se3 on a photonic crystal for the first time, and demonstrate a topological phase transition induced by the material phase change. Owing to the transparency of Sb2Se3 in both its amorphous and crystalline states, a high Q-factor on the order of 10^3 is preserved-representing nearly an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous GST-based devices. This work resolves the absorption-loss bottleneck in reconfigurable PTIs and paves the way for practical, low-loss, tunable topological photonic devices."}

Exact expressions for the orbital angular momentum density and the total angular momentum transmitted to the disk are obtained for both paraxial and nonparaxial regimes. By varying the beam wavelength, polarization, and cone angle, several experimentally relevant regimes of angular momentum transfer are identified. In the extreme nonparaxial regime, the absorbed angular momentum displays a staircase-like dependence on the object size, which can be interpreted as a geometric Hall-type response of the twisted field. The results suggest potential applications for controlled angular momentum transfer and size-sensitive probing of absorbing objects."}

This strategy works well for rotating-waveplate systems, where the accessible polarization states trace a curve on the Poincaré sphere and the corresponding optimization problem is generally well posed. However, it becomes degenerate for liquid-crystal-based systems, which can generate arbitrary polarization states, and whose additional degrees of freedom allow the optimization of metrics beyond the $\\ell^2$-condition number. Leveraging this unique advantage of liquid-crystal polarimeters, we introduce additional performance measures derived from alternative norms and error distributions computed via Monte Carlo simulations to inform the design of measurement schemes. We then experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in suppressing errors, paving the way for more robust and efficient polarization measurements."}
