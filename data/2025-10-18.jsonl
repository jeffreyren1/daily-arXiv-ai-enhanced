This work addresses\nthese limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC\nmetasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within\nthe generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that\nachieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific\nset of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form\nexpressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole\ncontributions. A physically realizable, asymmetric metasurface structure is\nthen designed to satisfy these theoretical conditions.

This paper provides the\nfirst systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND\nbeams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic\ngenerator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu)\nunder the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair\ncomparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture.\nThrough extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage\nregime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible\nlink-level gain.
