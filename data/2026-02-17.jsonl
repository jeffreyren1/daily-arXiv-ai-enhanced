We have performed detailed multiphysics quench analysis of such a nested stack high field magnet design under SuperEMFL project using our in-house software, which considers screening currents.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on geometric deformation while offering limited control over the global topology of the resulting optical space. Here we introduce a torus projection combined with a conformal mapping to construct a wormhole-like virtual optical geometry, providing a controllable route to manipulate optical-space topology within transformation optics. By tuning a single torus parameter, the virtual-space refractive index switches between isotropic and anisotropic forms, transforming point-like singularities in a disconnected geometry into extended transport channels that connect the optical space. This topology transition manifests as the opening or closure of an electromagnetic wormhole and is accompanied by pronounced changes in ray dynamics and cavity modes. Our results demonstrate how refractive-index anisotropy governs singularity structure and topology in transformation optics, providing a route to photonic systems with tunable optical geometry and connectivity."}

Vanadium redox flow batteries offer a viable option among other technologies, due to their long lifetime and independently scalable output power and capacity. The electrolyte temperature should be maintained within the range of 5-40 Celsius for safe operation; therefore, a thermal management system is necessary, which affects battery efficiency. The study presents a detailed, containerized battery model with a hybrid thermal management system that considers thermal radiation and real ambient temperatures. A total of 180 configurations were investigated in 10 cases, ranging from 4 to 400 kW, with 18 different discharging current-cell number ratios in each case, including multistack arrangements. Current-dependent ohmic losses influence the electric efficiency, which increases from a minimum of 68% to 89% in low-current configurations. However, the net system efficiency ranges between 43% and 66% due to the self-consumption of pumps, the inverter, and the thermal management system. In addition to the detailed efficiency analysis, a comprehensive investigation of thermal processes is provided in terms of the current-cell number ratio and output power, which is crucial for designing thermal management systems and sizing batteries."}

Design and simulation of such devices depend on accurate optical material data, especially the complex refractive index $n^*_{\\text{GaSb}} = n_{\\text{GaSb}} +ik_{\\text{GaSb}}$, consisting of the real part $n_{\\text{GaSb}}$ (refractive index) and the imaginary part $k_{\\text{GaSb}}$ (extinction coefficient). However, GaSb refractive index values are based either on theoretical models, typically informed by legacy experimental data, or on experimental measurements without quantified uncertainties.

Our results are based on two complementary measurements on a GaSb/AlAsSb-based heteroepitaxial structure under controlled environmental conditions: photometric transmission and layer-thickness analysis by cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy.

Emerging optoelectronic RC platforms,such as light-driven memristors, merge the benefits of electronic and photonic computation. However, conventional designs are often limited by the unipolar photoresponse of optoelectronic devices, which restricts reservoir state diversity and reduces computational accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an all-optically controlled RC system employing an oxide memristor array that demonstrates exceptional uniformity and stability. The memristive devices exhibit wavelength-dependent bipolar photoresponse, originating from light-induced dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies. Tuning the power density and irradiation mode of dual-wavelength light pulses enables dynamic control of photocurrent relaxation and nonlinearity. By leveraging these unique device properties, we develop bipolar and parallel coding strategies to significantly enrich reservoir dynamics and enhance nonlinear mapping capability. In word recognition and time-series prediction tasks, the bipolar coding demonstrates markedly improved accuracy compared to unipolar coding. The parallel coding supports multi-source signal fusion within a single reservoir, maintaining high computational accuracy while significantly reducing hardware consumption. This work provides a high-performance approach to physical RC, paving the way for intelligent edge computing."}

Nanophotonic platforms like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have played a critical role in providing refractometric sensing capabilities for clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. However, traditional systems operating in a single-polarization state cannot fully characterize complex optical properties such as birefringence, which is crucial to resolve many complex biological interactions. Although Bloch Surface Wave (BSW) sensors can support both TE and TM modes, a key capability SPR lacks, they have historically been implemented in single-mode configurations. In this paper, we present a polarization multiplexed BSW refractometric sensing system, simultaneously tracking the resonant wavelength shifts of both TE and TM BSW modes through time. Our technique was applied to investigate single-strand DNA growth during rolling circle amplification (RCA). To accurately recover the time-dependent birefringence, capturing dynamics of the DNA growth and orientation of its chains, we implemented a two-stage modeling approach based on the TMM. First, we utilized a wavelength-dependent surface sensitivity model, confining refractive index changes to the immediate layer above the crystal, to distinguish isotropic background dynamics from birefringent signals. Following the onset of RCA, we transitioned to a model that accounted for the vertical growth of the DNA layers in time. By fitting this model to the TE and TM resonant shifts, we monitor the growth rate of the single-strand DNA layer as well as the refractive index along the two polarization components. Our findings demonstrate the platform's ability to resolve the structural evolution of complex bimolecular interactions associated with conformational changes."}

Strongly interacting dipolar excitons in van der Waals heterostructures have attracted significant interest due to their out-of-plane electric dipole moments and high tunability via the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). However, leveraging these tunable dipolar excitons in strongly coupled exciton-photon systems to explore exotic many-body physics and macroscopic quantum phenomena remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the strong coupling of dipolar excitons in a gated bilayer MoS2 device integrated with a one-dimensional photonic crystal hosting bound-states-in-continuum (BIC). The resulting polaritons hybridize cavity photons with a coherent superposition of two electrically tunable anti-aligned dipolar excitons, effectively binding them into composite quasiparticle states. By tuning the dipolar excitons into non-degenerate states via the QCSE, we realize in situ reconfiguration of the polariton wavefunction and observe an emergent polariton branch exhibiting non-monotonic Stark shifts. Notably, these tunable polaritons allow for customized control over nonlinear interactions through distinct excitonic hybridization and dipolar configurations. This in situ tunability offers a scalable pathway toward electrically programmable quantum fluids of light and correlated polariton phases in on-chip photonic integrated circuits."}

However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds."}
