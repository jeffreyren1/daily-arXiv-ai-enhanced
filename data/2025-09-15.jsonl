Thus, the elimination of VT and\nVF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally,\ntheoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use\npartial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions\nwith spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical\ncounterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models\nof cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such\nspiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of\nlow-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate\nspiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method\nfor the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac\ntissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the\nionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the\ncorrelation length {\\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to\neliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We\nthen use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to\npredict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track\nthe propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of\nthe predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The\namplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small\nwhen {\\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of\nspiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods."}

In\npresence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to\nexplain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains\nor networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available\nlinks are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those\nlinks are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more\nimportantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work,\nwe make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity\nof Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive\nweights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the\nspectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus\nstrengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology.

Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of\ncells and particles (<50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput\nsorting of larger biomaterials and particles (>50 micrometer) has been more\nlimited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness\nof the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density)\nthat can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or\nparticles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with\na contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface\nacoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and\nparticles (<50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (<1 ms), high\nbiocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally,\nTSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based\ndetection technique.
