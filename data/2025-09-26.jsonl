Here, we show that\noptical chirality of plasmonic nanoparticles exhibiting strong scattering can\nremain completely undetected using standard characterisation techniques, such\nas circular dichroism measurements.

In ideal linear devices, however, this\nresponsivity gain is reconciled by a matching divergence in the quantum\nshot-noise floor, so the net signal-to-noise ratio remains unchanged. Recent\nwork has extended this argument to nonlinear devices, such as above-threshold\nlasers, predicting other divergences at an EP that is shifted by the interplay\nof noise and saturation effects.
