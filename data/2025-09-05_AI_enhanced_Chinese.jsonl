This paper presents the\nresults of 3 different configurations incorporating the Resilient Slip-Friction\nJoint (RSFJ) in: (1) tension-only braces (TOB), (2) tension-compression braces\n(TCB), and (3) moment-resisting frame (MRF) joints along the longitudinal\ndirection. Each building configuration was subjected to the El Centro ground\nmotion at increasing intensities, reaching a peak ground acceleration (PGA) of\nabout 0.5 g. The peak displacements sustained were well within design values,\nwith the top floor deflecting by 0.66%, 0.98% and 1.26% of the total height for\nthe TOB, TCB and MRF systems respectively. The corresponding inter-storey\ndrifts peaked at 0.87%, 1.11% and 1.62%. In all cases, the structures\nessentially self-centered with residual drifts limited to 0.03%. The floor\naccelerations observed in unidirectional tests were 0.67 g (TOB), 0.66 g (TCB)\nand 0.62 g (MRF).

In bidirectional tests,\ntorsion effects contributed to the largest acceleration recorded at 0.95 g\n(TCB). Unbalanced resistance/deformation of symmetric friction connections in\nthe transverse direction led to the structure twisting and loading the\nlongitudinal RSFJs unevenly. However, the effects on peak displacements were\nnot significant and similar responses as unidirectional tests indicate\neffective performance under simultaneous out-of-plane shaking.

Given the contactless interaction of light with matter,\nparticularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing.\nThis chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of\nanalyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical\npulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via\nreflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific\nnonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques\n(where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by\nthe duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the\ntransient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \\mu s) with respect to the\narrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on\nmicroscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in\nlaser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and\nshockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases,\nshielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring,\netc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes\nfor visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk\nof the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography,\ntomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging.

Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework to\nenhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3 based PSC through\nintegrated electronic and morphological engineering. Firstly, to address\ninterfacial recombination and inefficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL\njunction, we introduced a double hole transport layer (HTL) stack comprising\nCuO and I2O5-doped Spiro-OMeTAD, which significantly improved energy level\nalignment and carrier selectivity. Comprehensive multiphysics simulations,\ncombining finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) optical analysis with finite\nelement method (FEM) based electrical and thermal modeling, demonstrated that\noptimized doping concentrations and thickness parameters within the\nCuO/Spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layers can enhance the PCE to 22.78%. However,\nplanar architectures, while offering ease of fabrication and scalability,\nexhibit weak near-UV and near-infrared absorption, whereas nanostructures\nattain superior light trapping but incur significant fabrication complexity,\nunderscoring the need for balanced design strategies. To address these inherent\nlimitations, we propose a hierarchical ellipsoidal patterned solar cell\n(HEPSC), wherein a top-layer ellipsoidal nanostructure is introduced across the\nfull device stack.

However, multimode nonlinear\ninteractions often introduce considerable amounts of noise, limiting the\nultimate performance of these systems. It is therefore crucial to develop ways\nto simultaneously control complex nonlinear interactions while also gaining\ncontrol over their noise. Here, we show that noise buildup in nonlinear\nmultimode systems can be strongly suppressed by controlling the input\nwavefront. We demonstrate this approach in a multimode fiber by using an active\nwavefront-shaping protocol to focus a region of high intensity - yet low\nintensity noise - at the output. Our programmable control of both the input and\noutput reduces the beam noise by 12 dB beyond what linear attenuation achieves,\nreaching levels near the quantum shot-noise limit. We show that this is\npossible because the optimally shaped wavefront maximally decouples the output\nintensity fluctuations from the input laser fluctuations. These findings are\nsupported by a new theoretical and simulation framework that efficiently\ncaptures spatiotemporal quantum noise dynamics in highly multimode nonlinear\nsystems. Our results highlight the potential of programmable wavefront shaping\nto enable nonlinear multimode technologies that overcome noise buildup to\noperate at quantum-noise limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6ce2\u524d\u5f62\u72b6\u6765\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u901a\u5e38\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u6ce2\u524d\u6574\u5f62\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u6ce2\u524d\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u5149\u7ea4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6ce2\u524d\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5149\u675f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86 12 dB\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u7c92\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u51fa\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u5149\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6ce2\u524d\u6574\u5f62\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u903c\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u9650\u3002"}}
