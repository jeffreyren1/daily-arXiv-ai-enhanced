Crystal-field, hyperfine,and electron-deformation interactions", "comment": "20 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Optical transmission spectra of YAl3(BO3)4 crystals doped with the Pr3+ ions in concentrations 1 and 2.5 at. % were studied by high-resolution (up to 0.05 cm-1) Fourier spectroscopy, including in magnetic field parallel to the trigonal c axis of the crystal. The g factors of several crystal-field doublets of Pr3+ were determined. The crystal-field calculations performed using the exchange-charge model and high-resolution spectroscopy data allowed us to obtain a physically reasonable set of crystal-field parameters. The observed splitting of a number of doublets in zero magnetic field is explained by the presence of random lattice deformations. Simulation of the profiles of observed deformational doublets was carried out taking into account both hyperfine and electron-deformation interactions. The width of the distribution function of random strains was estimated. The main sources of random strains in YAl3(BO3)4:Pr3+ crystals are discussed."}

The ability to perform such spatial reformatting operations has many future applications in both classical and quantum photonics, spanning from optical communications to photonic computing and imaging. MPLCs are intricate optical systems consisting of a cascade of inverse-designed diffractive optical elements, typically separated by free-space. In this work we investigate the fabrication of miniaturised fully-encapsulated transmissive MPLCs within a glass chip using single-step direct laser writing. Our approach relies on the formation of femto-second laser induced birefringent nanogratings with a spatially controllable fast axis orientation. The glass chip is internally patterned with layers of these nanogratings to create multiple geometric phase holograms which imprint controllable phase patterns onto circularly polarised light propagating through them. We experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept glass-embedded 700x700x2000 micrometer cubed MPLCs: a 3-mode and a 10-mode Hermite-Gaussian mode sorter. We discuss the fabrication challenges and future improvements of these devices. Our work plots a path towards the rapid prototyping of robust monolithic MPLC technology."}

Traditionally, these measurements are performed with grating or Fourier-transform spectrometers using incoherent light sources. Leveraging coherent light enables powerful frequency-comb-based techniques, but is limited by the technical complexity of efficiently generating broad spectral bandwidths from relatively narrowband and spectrally distant laser sources. Current visible dual-comb spectrometers require implicit compromises between optical bandwidth, experimental simplicity, and acquisition speed. In this work, we introduce a simple and efficient dual-comb spectrometer that converts robust Er:fiber frequency combs from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet and visible with thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) nanophotonic waveguides. Using real-time signal processing, we retrieve coherently averaged dual-comb spectra over nearly 120 THz of simultaneous bandwidth in the visible with 100 MHz spectral resolution. With these capabilities, we measure the broadband absorption spectrum of molecular iodine (I2), demonstrating the broadest visible spectral coverage of a dual-comb spectrometer to date. Additional measurements of NO2, atomic rubidium, and atomic sodium further illustrate the achievable combination of spectroscopic bandwidth, resolution, and intrinsic frequency accuracy. Our results demonstrate the powerful integration of low-power frequency combs, nonlinear nanophotonics, and digital signal processing to enable a compact, efficient and versatile approach to high-resolution mapping of complex absorption spectra across 500 THz in the UV-visible and near-infrared spectral regions for multiple applications beyond the research lab"}

This method achieves deposition rates 8-12 times faster than electrospinning and can be applied directly onto nonplanar, nonconductive objects. The resulting membranes, composed of styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) fibers embedded with Y2O3 nanoparticles, achieve sub-ambient cooling of up to 7.0 °C outdoors, effectively delaying ice melting.

As the system approaches a critical concentration, the stretching exponent $β$ tends to zero, signaling a crossover to scale-free, power-law behavior. A stochastic cellular automaton based on this aging rule reproduces the emergent filaments and their concentration-dependent thickening.

Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials."}

Our noise-suppression strategy, leveraging soliton self-frequency shift and spectral filtering, effectively suppresses EO comb phase noise without requiring active stabilization. The resulting THz comb exhibits broad spectral coverage (0.05-4 THz), narrow comb linewidths (0.3 Hz at the Fourier-transform limit), and excellent frequency stability (8.6*10^-14 at 1-second integration). We further demonstrate asynchronous THz time-domain spectroscopy, resolving ~36,000 comb lines with 50 MHz spacing. Crucially, the inherent frequency agility of the EO comb enables rapid and wide-range tuning of the THz comb line spacing. These attributes position our THz comb as a versatile tool for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precision THz metrology."}

In this study, we demonstrate a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based reservoir computing system with augmented temporal and spatial nonlinearity by utilizing both gate and substrate terminals as inputs. The ferroelectric polarization state in the next time step can additionally be controlled by modifying the electric field distribution in the gate stack of FeFET through a substrate input, enabling more diverse internal states compared with the case where inputs are applied only to the gate. To introduce a nonlinearity in the time domain, we introduce a delay between a gate input and a substrate input, which facilitates efficient nonlinear mixing between the current and past inputs. As a result, both the short-term memory and nonlinearity of the FeFET reservoir computing system are enhanced with an improved capability of feature extraction of complex input time-series. These findings demonstrate that introducing substrate input provides an additional degree of freedom for controlling ferroelectric polarization dynamics, enabling a flexible, energy-efficient, and highly integrable FeFET-based reservoir computing platform suitable for diverse time-series processing applications."}

Numerical simulations reveal distinct collision regimes ranging from nearly elastic scattering to strongly inelastic interactions leading to long-lived merged states. We demonstrate that the transition between these regimes is primarily controlled by the relative phase of the solitons at the collision point, with out-of-phase collisions suppressing overlap and in-phase collisions promoting strong interaction. Kinetic-energy diagnostics are introduced to quantitatively characterize collision outcomes and to identify phase- and separation-dependent windows of elasticity. To interpret the observed dynamics, we extract effective phase-dependent interaction potentials from collision trajectories, providing a mechanical picture of attraction and repulsion between flat-top solitons. The stability of merged states formed after strongly inelastic collisions is explained by their lower energetic cost, arising from interfacial energetics, where a balance between internal pressure and edge tension plays a central role. A variational analysis based on direct energy minimization supports this picture by revealing robust energetic minima associated with stationary two-dimensional flat-top solitons."}

The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge."}

Here we overcome this limitation by using a microresonator-anchored ultrafast sweeping Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser for mid-IR spectroscopy. We introduce a dual-microresonator-anchor approach: a microcomb provides frequency calibration and a high-Q microresonator resolves the instantaneous FDML lasing lineshape. The strategy enables accurate correction of the FDML laser's sweep nonlinearity and broad linewidth in the near-IR, allowing the FDML laser to function as a high-fidelity mid-IR light via difference frequency generation.

Originally conceived to elucidate the physics of a molecular chain of polyacetylene, this model has found widespread applications in exploring a wide range of topological phenomena in photonics and beyond. In this chapter, we aim to provide an overview of topological photonics in one-dimensional (1D) settings. After briefly introducing paradigmatic 1D models, including the SSH, Rice-Mele, and AAH models, we review recent advances in experimental studies and applications of topological photonics based on 1D platforms. Our discussion highlights demonstrated examples, such as the nonlinear tuning of topological states in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian photonic SSH lattices, as well as nonlinear harmonic generation and topological lasing in SSH-type photonic microstructures. We further discuss characteristic topological phenomena in other representative 1D settings, including Floquet systems, topological pumping, quasicrystals, and synthetic non-Hermitian systems. Finally, we examine selected examples of two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological crystalline insulators that are closely linked to the SSH model.

To meet this need, Brillouin light scattering (BLS) has emerged as a noncontact, high-resolution elastography tool that probes the GHz-frequency longitudinal modulus of materials. This longitudinal modulus reflects both elastic and viscous behavior at microscopic scales. However, interpreting Brillouin spectra in biological specimens is challenging: in highly hydrated samples the Brillouin shift is dominated by water dynamics, and the GHz longitudinal modulus does not directly equate to conventional low-frequency stiffness measures (e.g. Young's or shear moduli). Debates remain about how hydration and polymer relaxation influence the Brillouin signal, and how to relate it to macroscopic biomechanics. In particular, the longitudinal viscosity measured by Brillouin scattering includes a contribution from bulk viscosity, which is absent in standard shear rheology and often overlooked. To address these issues, we used different hydrogel systems and solvent mixtures to show Brillouin spectra are modulated but not dominated by hydration. By varying gelatin concentration, we demonstrated that Brillouin shifts can either positively or negatively correlate with water content, depending on the underlying mechanical response. Measurements on ethanol water mixtures further clarify this behavior. Although the Brillouin shift varies strongly with composition, it does not follow water content monotonically and instead reflects changes in the mixture's mechanical properties. By comparing longitudinal, bulk, and shear viscosities, we also showed that bulk viscous dissipation plays a significant role in the Brillouin response. These results established a mechanical framework for interpreting Brillouin spectrum in hydrated and biomolecular systems."}

Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for quantum light sources, as individual QDs are reliable single photon emitters even at room temperature. However, photon bunching, a key signature of collective many-body states, has been so far largely observed at cryogenic temperatures in perovskite materials, limiting their applications under ambient conditions. Here, we report the observation of collective blinking and photon bunching in perovskite QD superlattices at room temperature. Sub-wavelength-sized (100 - 500 nm) CsPbBr3 QD superlattices, fabricated via a self-assembly process, exhibit an unusual two-level blinking behavior similar to that of single QDs, and demonstrate photon bunching with a degree of up to 2.75. Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements and super-resolution imaging reveal that the superlattices have a significantly longer PL lifetime than individual QDs and that their emission is spatially confined to regions tens of nanometers in size. These observations suggest long-range exciton migration to a localized energy trap within the superlattice. Excitation power dependent degree of bunching and analysis of the bunching dynamics indicate that the photon bunching originates from exciton-biexciton cascade emission, a key mechanism for generating entangled photons.

In contrast to low-power domain where the output power distribution in the cores is random with large fluctuations sensitive to fiber disturbances, at high power of the input pulse injected in the central core the output power becomes equalized between the cores with fluctuations reduced to <5% being insensitive to disturbances. Similar behavior is observed in cut-back experiments showing that equi-partition is approached at a distance of ~5 m.

Here we show that coupling molecular chirality to the topological structure of twisted light generates a protected phase observable that survives strong scattering. When Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum propagate through chiral media, spin-orbit interaction converts circular birefringence into an azimuthal rotation of the helical wavefront. Remarkably, this chiral phase memory persists at scattering strengths that fully depolarize conventional beams, with the rotation magnitude preserved quantitatively between transparent solutions and strongly scattering tissue. The sign of the azimuthal rotation encodes molecular handedness: opposite enantiomers produce mirror-symmetric phase maps even after multiple scattering. Differential measurements between conjugate topological charges isolate the chiral contribution while cancelling achiral background, enabling the resolution of refractive-index changes of order 10-6.
