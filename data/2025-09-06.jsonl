A 50 {\\Omega} ladder filter based on single-layer thin film\nScAlN with Platinum (Pt) electrodes was demonstrated at 11.7 GHz with a 3 dB\nfractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than\n23.1 dB. However, the filter exhibits a moderate insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB,\nwhich is attributed to a limited Quality (Q) factor in the constituent\nresonators. Consequently, we identify and analyze three primary challenges in\nfrequency scaling ScAlN FBARs with thinner film stacks: 1) degradation of\npiezoelectric thin-film crystal quality, 2) increased series resistance in\nultra-thin electrodes, and 3) residual film stress that limits device size and\nstructural integrity.

The choice of 30% aluminum concentration allowed us to reduce pump\nabsorption and photoluminescence background for photon pairs generation at\ntelecom wavelengths by at least an order of magnitude compared to that of GaAs.\nThe specific layer orientation facilitates the generation of orthogonally\npolarized entangled photons, a prerequisite for polarization-entangled states.\nRather than directly probing entanglement, we observe the effect of hidden\npolarization. Our results highlight AlGaAs (111) as a promising platform for\nscalable quantum photonic sources and shed light on nonclassical polarization\neffects accessible through flat-optics engineering."}

A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a\nnarrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR)\nphotons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity\nleads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced\nupconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum,\nand quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates\nin actual devices. In this study, we added an n--p--n double-tunnel-junction\nstructure to an $\\mathrm{Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As}$/GaAs TPU-SC including a QD layer\nto further enhance the contribution of intraband absorption to the output\ncurrent. The double-tunnel-junction structure should suppress carrier\nrecombination at the heterointerface and improve the extraction efficiency of\nelectrons after intraband absorption. We performed two-color excitation\nexperiments using IR and 784-nm light, and we particularly found that 784-nm\nlight causes a significant amount of intraband transitions in this device. By\nemploying rate equations, we clarify that this result demonstrates a higher\nintraband absorption efficiency due to the double-tunnel-junction structure.\nThis highlights the potential of double-tunnel-junction structures for the\nrealization of high-efficiency TPU-SCs."}

Among these,\nwhispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in\nspherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular\nbarcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic\nspherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing.\nAlthough lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been\nharnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM\nresonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW)\nlaser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these\nresonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling\nreal-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute\nscale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We\nsystematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its\nability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to\nforskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss,\nwell before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes\nintracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live\nsingle-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment\nof adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk\nassays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and\nobesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels."}

Yet,\nprior demonstrations have been limited in spectral range due to the inherently\nlow mechanical frequencies. In this work, we report a phononic comb with a\nrecord span from 1 to 70 GHz. This result is achieved by harnessing the strong\nmechanical nonlinearity of a $2.5$-$\\mu$m-radius silicon carbide microdisk,\nwhich supports a radial breathing mode at $1.655$ GHz with a mechanical quality\nfactor of 13,500. With just 1 mW of dropped optical power, radiation pressure\nfrom a continuous-wave pump drives strong phonon lasing, generating 42\nphase-locked harmonics with $1.655$ GHz spacing. The combination of such broad\nbandwidth, low phase noise (-132 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency) and\nfrequency stability ($<10^{-7}$ at 1 second of averaging time) positions this\nultracompact phononic comb as a powerful platform for diverse applications."}
