This regime is somewhat reminiscent of the Cherenkov regime, in which the velocity of a charged particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in a medium. However, because it involves two media and a moving interface, it gives rise to richer and more complex scattering dynamics, with a single scattered wave when the incident wave propagates in the same direction as the interface and three scattered waves when they propagate in opposite directions. Existing studies address only limited non-magnetic configurations, and a general formulation has yet to be established. In this paper, we present a complete and general solution to scattering in the interluminal regime using a symmetric decomposition approach based on subluminal and superluminal limit interfaces, together with a space-time impulse response. This approach provides clear physical insight into the scattering features of the interluminal regime. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between the subluminal and superluminal regimes and elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying interluminal scattering."}

We develop a fully theoretical two-dimensional (2D) framework for a coated acoustic cylinder in an air background. Using an exact cylindrical-harmonic solution of the Helmholtz equation, we compute the modal scattering coefficients a_m(omega) for a core of radius a surrounded by two concentric effective-fluid layers, and we design the coating to cancel the dominant low-order multipoles (monopole m=0 and dipole m=+/-1) at a target frequency, yielding a narrowband near-cloak. Beyond the conventional energetic metric (total scattering width), we quantify information-based detectability through the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the associated Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint estimation of the size-material parameter vector x=[a, rho1, c1]^T from noisy far-field data. A representative air-background study exhibits an approximately 25 dB reduction in total scattering width near the design frequency, while tr(FIM) decreases by only a few dB, demonstrating that energy-based and inference-based notions of invisibility are distinct objectives. We further provide a low-order analytic argument clarifying the mechanism behind this energetic-informational decoupling and report design-space and local-robustness diagnostics that highlight persistent trade-offs between scattering suppression and parameter identifiability."}

We classify topologically trivial photonic bands using SRSIs, treating them as the fundamental building blocks of 3D photonic band structures. This means that if certain bands cannot be constructed from these building blocks, they are necessarily topological. Furthermore, we distinguish between photonic and electronic band structures by analyzing which SRSI values are allowed in systems with and without polarization singularity. We also explore the impact of the polarization singularity on the behavior of Wilson loops, providing new insights into the topological classification of 3D photonic systems."}

We study the resulting spatial dynamics of this family, showing that travelling wave solutions are present in those dynamics corresponding to the directed 5- and 6-cycles, but not the 4-cycle.

These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices."}

SCNet combines a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with material-aware routing, wavelet-based frequency decomposition to separate structure from speckle across sub-bands, and a curriculum-style optimization that progressively enforces spectral consistency before spatial fidelity. Using an ultrathin dual-fiber holographic probe, we deliver wavefront-shaped illumination through one s and collect backscattered photons through a parallel MMF. We validate SCNet on 3D plastic objects over varying working distances, resolve 5.66 lp/mm on a paper USAF target, and restore fine structures on leaves and metal surfaces. On rabbit heart and kidney tissues, SCNet improves recovery of low-contrast anatomical texture under the same ultrathin collection constraint. We further compress SCNet through multi-teacher distillation to reduce computation while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling inference at 60 FPS. This work effectively decouples image quality from probe size, establishing a speckle-free ultrathin endoscopy for stand-off imaging in confined spaces."}

A slender-beam structure instrumented with collocated piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs distributed periodically along the length is used as the host medium, with decentralized second-order low-pass resonant filter with negative position feedback controllers implemented in real time on an FPGA platform. Unlike conventional approaches that assess bandgap formation through tip displacement, this study relies on bending strain minimization of piezoelectric sensors as the principal indicator of control-induced bandgaps. This reflects more accurately the moment-based phase cancellation dynamics similar to resonator behavior. We derive analytical expressions for transmissibility in an n x n decentralized feedback architecture and verify them experimentally using a 7 x 7 unit-cell configuration. The findings show that resonant controllers with negative feedback applied at the unit-cell level can be systematically tuned through controller gain and damping to open targeted low-frequency bandgaps and significantly improve vibration attenuation. By shifting the focus to localized dynamics, this work deepens the understanding of how control-induced bandgaps emerge and demonstrates a scalable pathway for designing programmable mechatronic metamaterials based on unconventional resonator behavior."}

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel calculation method based on Fermat's principle that directly and efficiently determines the reflection point by minimizing the optical path length from a point light source to a hologram pixel via the mirror surface, using Newton's method for optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces computation time compared to previous approaches.

The method uses a nonisolated, lossless five-port hybrid waveguide combiner for power combining.

The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree. In contrast, when a phase-locked loop was introduced, the phase fluctuation reduced significantly to approximately 0.5 degree. This phase accuracy can fully meet the requirements of combining experiments. Four magnetrons worked in injection-locked states without phase-locked loop. The proposed power-combining system is designed, measured, and analyzed. Measurement results show that a high-power-combining efficiency of over 95% is achieved by injection-locked magnetron without PLL, with the best efficiency reaching up to 97.7% with phase control of the injected signals. Experimental results reveal that the magnetron phase-pushing effects and the ripple in high-power dc voltage and current have a minor impact of approximately 4% on the combining efficiency."}

We evaluate the photonic quasicrystal accurately by a generalized spectral method that embeds the quasiperiodic structure into a higher-dimensional periodic system. We study the spectral distribution of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals and find some interesting phenomena. As the computational resolution N increases, there are more eigenvalues within finite frequency bandwidths, and the maximum localization always occurs at spectral gap edges for states near index N + 1. By varying βwithin the range of (0,1), we present a butterfly-shaped spectral structure with abundant band gaps. We find that the spectral structure factor Q (defined as I_{mg}/N, where I_{mg} is the maximum gap index) exhibits different linear patterns as βchanges: Q = 1 - βwhen β< βc, while Q = βwhen β> βc, where βc \\approx 0.424 is the transition point. This linear relationship holds robustly in the strong quasiperiodic regime (βaway from 0 or 1) and is independent of the specific type of irrational number used. The relationship disappears (weak quasiperiodic regime) near β= 0 or β= 1. It demonstrates that the intrinsic spectral properties of one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals are fundamentally governed by the magnitude of the irrational parameter β."}

Under review at Nonlinear Dynamics", "summary": "This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems."}

The method combines inverse-designed microstructured phase masks with photopolymer resins engineered for controlled optical absorption. By precisely tailoring the phase-mask topography, we generate arbitrary 3D light-intensity distributions within the resin, including intentionally encoded dark regions that define hollow internal features. Simultaneously, the resin formulation is designed to balance optical penetration with sufficient local energy deposition to achieve high-fidelity polymerization throughout the volume. Using this approach, millimeter-scale architectures comprising more than $10^{6}$ addressable voxels are fabricated in a single 7.5~s exposure, corresponding to a volumetric throughput of $\\sim$1~mm$^{3}$/s ($>10^{5}$~voxels/s).

The mapping leaves the spectrum unchanged but reshapes each eigenfunction by a realization-dependent random-walk envelope. In a parameter regime where the Hermitian counterpart hosts spectrally isolated in-gap boundary modes, we identify two such modes with sharply different responses to the envelope: one stays anchored at the boundary, while the other is controllable via the gauge, allowing its peak intensity to be relocated solely by altering the gauge setup without modifying the associated eigenenergy. Additionally, we demonstrate that this steerable mode can be preferentially enhanced and generated from an initial bulk wavefunction by introducing mild site-specific amplification at a location determined exclusively from the Hermitian model using the biorthogonal function.

Here, we introduce a new type of at-$Γ$ BICs of photonic crystal (PhC) slabs supporting higher diffraction orders, which we call hybrid BICs (h-BICs), whereby symmetry protection and parameter tuning are utilized to suppress light emission in the zeroth- and higher-diffraction orders, respectively. By tuning certain structural parameters of the PhC slab, we fully characterize the dynamics of the topological structure of these h-BICs, including the generation, merging, splitting, and annihilation of circularly polarized states. We further show that the relative amount of light radiated in the first-order diffraction channels can be effectively controlled by simply breaking the $C_{4v}$ symmetry of the PhC slab. Our findings reveal a versatile approach to realize new types of BICs above the diffraction limit, and could potentially inspire new efforts towards development of novel photonic nanodevices, such as multi vortex-beam generators, frequency converters, and lasers."}

However, the current researches are mainly focused on their physical structures and system functions, while radio-frequency (RF) signal processing and calculation remain constrained to digital-domain operations. This reliance on digital conversion inherently increases hardware complexity and power consumption. To address this challenge, we propose a programmable RF calculation system based on a space-time-coding metasurface (STCM), which can control the wave-matter interactions through space-time-coding (STC) strategies and achieve direct RF calculations in the electromagnetic (EM) space in a reprogrammable way. Particularly, the fundamental signal operations - Fourier transform and convolution - are implemented in the EM-wave domain successfully. We validate the RF calculation capabilities in radar scenarios, facilitating the accurate detection of target velocity and range. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results collectively demonstrate that the STCM-based RF calculation system exhibits superior precision, enhanced operational efficiency, and notable cost-effectiveness, highlighting its significant potentials for the next-generation electronic system deployments."}

In electron microscopy, this divide limits the ability to quantify three-dimensional topography from two-dimensional projections, fundamentally constraining our understanding of nanoscale structure-function relationships. Here, we present a physics-embedded neural computational microscopy framework that achieves metrological three-dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable electron-optical forward model with deep learning. By introducing a Vision Field Transformer as a high-speed, differentiable surrogate for physical process analysis simulations, we establish an end-to-end, self-supervised optimization loop that enforces strict physical consistency with hardware geometry. This synergy enables single-shot, quantitative three-dimensional nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force microscopy but at orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability for four-dimensional (3D real space plus time) in situ characterization by tracking the dynamic evolution of surface nanostructure during copper redox, revealing hidden crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional imaging. Our work not only redefines the limits of scanning electron microscopy but also establishes a generalizable archetype for solving ill-posed inverse problems across physical sciences, unlocking the full potential of simulation as a third pillar of discovery."}

State-of-the-art references typically rely on electronic co-Pound-Drever-Hall locking to ultrahigh-Q microresonators-a complex approach that introduces servo bumps and increases footprint. Alternatively, optical co-self-injection-locking (co-SIL) offers inherent simplicity but is limited by the large thermo-refractive noise and confined mode volumes of integrated cavities. Here, we demonstrate a two-point OFD-based microwave oscillator that combines an ultrahigh-Q miniature Fabry-Perot cavity with optical co-SIL. Leveraging its low relative phase noise optical reference and combing with an integrated soliton microcomb, the system generates a microwave with phase noise of -147 dBc/Hz at 4 kHz offset (scaled to 10 GHz)-performance rivalling most electronically stabilized systems. This work marries the superior noise floor of ultrahigh-Q cavities with the simplicity of optical locking, providing a compact, cost-effective, and field-deployable path to pure microwaves for next-generation communications, radar and metrology."}

Since the inception of microresonator-based nonlinear optics, related studies have focused primarily on regimes in which photons with distinct resonant modes can interact. Although multiple comb lines can occupy a single resonance during the Kerr comb formation process, their mutual interactions have remained largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate a Kerr comb formation that is confined to a single resonance of a microresonator via dual-pumping. MHz-scale comb-line spacing reveals previously unobserved Kerr-comb dynamics, featuring parametrically driven phase multistability that can be observed directly in the temporal domain. Two laser pumps serve as phase-coupled references for heterodyne read-out, simplifying the measurements."}

However, scaling these systems has been prevented by the high power consumption and thermal crosstalk of conventional volatile phase shifters. Here, we demonstrate the first non-volatile field-programmable photonic gate array, implemented on a hybrid silicon-barium titanate platform. Unlike traditional thermo-optic devices that require constant power to maintain a state, our device utilizes ferroelectric domain switching to provide non-volatile memory, allowing optical circuits to be programmed and retained without any holding power or electrical bias. The hexagonal waveguide mesh integrates 58 programmable unit cells and 116 actuators, achieving nanosecond-scale switching speeds of 80 nanoseconds while reducing static power consumption to negligible levels (560 nanowatts per π phase shift). To validate this platform, we configured the mesh to perform diverse signal processing functions, including tunable filtering, 4x4 linear unitary transformations, and optical routing. This work establishes non-volatile ferroelectric silicon photonics as a scalable, heat-free platform essential for the next generation of energy-efficient photonic computing."}

In quantum technologies, achieving non-local coherent coupling between solid-state qubits is of the utmost importance. Here, we demonstrate that excitons - i.e. electron-hole pairs bound by the Coulomb force within a quantum well - can act as a medium for mesoscopic optical coherence transfer in semiconductors. To this end, we use a femtosecond laser pulse to resonantly generate excitons within the light cone. These excitons can then either recombine radiatively or scatter out of the light cone, gaining an in-plane momentum in the process. In samples without disorder, such as the CdTe quantum wells used here, the resulting fast excitons can diffuse over mesoscopic distances before recombining radiatively. Using coherent nonlinear micro-spectroscopy, we carry out exciton time-of-flight measurements. Specifically, we monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of launched exciton wave packets, selectively observing their coherence or density on a scale of up to 10$\\,μ$m. Our proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that free excitons inherit a phase modulation from the optical pulsed excitation and can generate coherent links within excitonic circuits, offerring a higher level of miniaturisation and compactness than photonic or polaritonic architectures."}

Here we demonstrate a self-optimizing multichannel optical computing architecture based on multi-plane light conversion that natively processes RGB images and structured numerical data throughout the optical domain. We introduce two complementary optimization strategies that enable autonomous performance adaptation without differentiable forward models. First, Bayesian optimization tunes channel mixing coefficients to minimize crosstalk and enhance feature separability at the input level. Second, a hardware-in-the-loop protocol based on self-organized criticality leverages avalanche dynamics to autonomously navigate the high-dimensional phase landscape, enabling the system to self-optimize through stochastic multi-scale perturbations. Across medical imaging, natural image classification, and regression tasks, multichannel processing with random phase masks improves accuracy by 26--58 percentage points over raw pixel baselines, with RGB systematically outperforming grayscale by 5--6 percentage points. Self-optimization strategies provide additional gains of 6--7 percentage points through autonomous adaptation at complementary system levels.

We first optimize regular polygonal structures to suppress the photonic density of states and find that the best performing polygon is consistent with a tiling of space with hexagonal unit cells. We next show that introducing cavities into hexagonal structures further suppresses the photonic density of states, particularly when the cavity is also hexagonal. Such a result would find application in the design of fiber-optic cables. We then describe an approach for optimizing arbitrary x-simple or y-simple designs that can recover finite supercells of a hexagonal unit cell. Our approach can therefore discover the symmetry of photonic-crystal primitive unit cells that significantly suppress the photonic density of states for a given set of material parameters within a single optimization."}

The matrix is formed by the coupling constants between the resonators, and the input vector is formed by the initial occupancies of the involved modes. The frequency of the collective oscillations is growing with the number of the involved modes, similarly to Rabi oscillations. The time needed for their detection, i.e., averaging, decreases with an increase in the input vector dimension. We discuss the limitations imposed on parallel computation in the system by restriction of the allowed optical frequency band."}
