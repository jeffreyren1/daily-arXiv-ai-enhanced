In fundamental modelocking, a single intracavity pulse\nprovides high stability and reproducibility, but limits the repetition rate.\nHarmonic modelocking can overcome this by supporting multiple pulses, but\nsuffers from instabilities and poor reproducibility, with specific states\nachievable only sporadically. Biology exploits hierarchy to organise\ncomplexity, which has inspired hierarchical self-assembly in the laboratory.\nHere, building on the Brownian-particle characteristics of modelocked pulses,\nwe introduce a theoretical framework that treats multi-pulse modelocking as a\nhierarchical self-assembly problem. This involves timescales spanning up to 14\norders of magnitude, yet with a natural hierarchy in which fast variables are\nslaved to slower ones. We exploit this hierarchy to reduce their complex\ndynamics into nested low-dimensional subsystems governing pulse shape, energy,\ngain, and positions. The resulting framework reveals how to reliably reach\ntarget states with precise pulse number and spacing. We experimentally validate\nthe predictions in a Mamyshev laser with over 100 pulses, limited only by\navailable power.
