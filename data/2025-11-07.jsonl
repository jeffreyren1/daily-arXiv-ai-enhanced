Reading and writing information to these bits through\nmechanical interactions opens the possibility of operating the magnetic devices\nwith low heat generation and high density recording. To achieve this visionary\ngoal, we demonstrate the use of magnetic exchange force microscopy to read and\nwrite the spin orientation of individual holmium adatoms on MgO thin films. The\nspin orientation of the holmium adatom is stabilized by the strong uniaxial\nanisotropy of the adsorption site and can be read out by measuring the exchange\nforces between the magnetic tip and the atom. The spin orientation can be\nwritten by approaching the tip closer to the holmium adatom.We explain this\nwriting mechanism by the symmetry reduction of the adsorption site of the Ho\nadatom.

Among key advances made are that the\n$^{239}$Pu file was reevaluated by a joint international effort and that\nupdated $^{16,18}$O, $^{19}$F, $^{28-30}$Si, $^{50-54}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn,\n$^{54,56,57}$Fe, $^{63,65}$Cu, $^{139}$La, $^{233,235,238}$U, and\n$^{240,241}$Pu neutron nuclear data from the IAEA coordinated INDEN\ncollaboration were adopted. Over 60 neutron dosimetry cross sections were\nadopted from the IAEA's IRDFF-II library. In addition, the new library includes\nsignificant changes for $^3$He, $^6$Li,$^9$Be, $^{51}$V, $^{88}$Sr, $^{103}$Rh,\n$^{140,142}$Ce, Dy, $^{181}$Ta, Pt, $^{206-208}$Pb, and $^{234,236}$U neutron\ndata, and new nuclear data for the photonuclear, charged-particle and atomic\nsublibraries. Numerous thermal neutron scattering kernels were reevaluated or\nprovided for the very first time. On the covariance side, work was undertaken\nto introduce better uncertainty quantification standards and testing for\nnuclear data covariances. The significant effort to reevaluate important\nnuclides has reduced bias in the simulations of many integral experiments with\nparticular progress noted for fluorine, copper, and stainless steel containing\nbenchmarks. Data issues hindered the successful deployment of the previous\nENDF/B-VIII.0 for commercial nuclear power applications in high burnup\nsituations. These issues were addressed by improving the $^{238}$U and\n$^{239,240,241}$Pu evaluated data in the resonance region. The new library\nperformance as a function of burnup is similar to the reference ENDF/B-VII.1\nlibrary.

In the absence of time variability,\nthe ordinary differential equations have an equilibrium point that represents\ncoexisting predators and prey. The time dependence removes this equilibrium\nsolution, but the equilibrium point is restored by allowing the predation rate\nalso to vary in time. This equilibrium can undergo a parametric resonance\ninstability, leading to subharmonic and harmonic time-periodic behavior, which\npersists even when the predation rate is constant. We also find period-doubling\nbifurcations and chaotic dynamics. If we allow the population densities to vary\nin space as well as time, introducing diffusion into the model, we find that\nvariations in space diffuse away when the underlying dynamics is periodic in\ntime, but spatiotemporal structure persists when the underlying dynamics is\nchaotic. We interpret this as a competition between diffusion, which makes the\npopulation densities homogeneous in space, and chaos, where sensitive\ndependence on initial conditions leads to different locations in space\nfollowing different trajectories in time. Patterns and spatial structure are\nknown to enhance resilience in ecosystems, suggesting that chaotic\ntime-dependent dynamics arising from seasonal variations in carrying capacity\nand leading to spatial structure, might also enhance resilience."}

This paper gives an affirmative answer: optimal sparse\ncoupling configurations can be found which enables near-complete\nsynchronization. Quite surprisingly, with respect to synchronization, certain\nsparse networks can outperform fully coupled networks, when the weights of\ncoupling are placed dominantly on the laser pairs with large frequency\ndifferences.

In light of recent experiments demonstrating\nhigh-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this\nwork we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning\nexciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton\ninteracting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well\nas with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear\nequations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's\ncoefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which\ntranslates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the\nform of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear\nstability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question,\nwhich allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly\nimportant for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the\nconsidered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific\ncase of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton\ninteracts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable,\nprovided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity\nvalue defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore,\ninteractions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of\nmodulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions.

We investigate the behavior of a Shockley-Read-Hall recombination\nvia Al vacancies-oxygen complexes in AlN barriers as a function of GaN well\nthickness and come to the conclusion that direct relaxation of confined states\nvia mid-gap traps is prohibited and the main mechanism limiting the quantum\nefficiency (QE) is the carrier escape followed by non-radiative SRH\nrecombination in the AlN barriers. As a consequence, the QE is highly dependent\non the defect density, QW width and temperature which allowed us to reach a\ndescent emissions at 226 nm wavelength although at wall plug efficiency being\nlow, at 0.02%.

However, unlocking many of the most scientifically intriguing and\ntechnologically promising phenomena requires entering the strong coupling\nregime, where light and matter fully mix, unlocking emergent properties of the\ncoupled states. Nowadays, distinguishing between weak and strong coupling\nprimarily relies on studying the optical response of the hybrid system at real\nfrequencies, which only provides indirect estimates of the underlying resonant\ndynamics. In contrast, the actual resonances live at complex frequencies.\nResolving this contradiction, we show that photonic resonant states provide the\nframework to unambiguously quantify the strength of light-matter interaction,\nenabling a rigorous distinction between weak and strong coupling regimes.\nAssuming a single dominant resonant state of the bare photonic resonator, we\nderive an effective Hamiltonian that captures the interaction between the\nphotonic resonator and an arbitrary number of material resonances. Our analysis\nreveals that, unlike most coupled-oscillator models commonly employed in the\nliterature, hybridization not only introduces off-diagonal coupling but also\nshifts the bare eigenfrequency of the photonic mode.

In light of recent experiments demonstrating\nhigh-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this\nwork we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning\nexciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton\ninteracting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well\nas with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear\nequations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's\ncoefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which\ntranslates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the\nform of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear\nstability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question,\nwhich allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly\nimportant for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the\nconsidered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific\ncase of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton\ninteracts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable,\nprovided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity\nvalue defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore,\ninteractions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of\nmodulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions.
