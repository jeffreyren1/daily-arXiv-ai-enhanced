Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) is a leading solution, forming a spectrogram by scanning the delay between two pulse replicas and recording the nonlinear signal spectrum. In online settings, however, dense delay-frequency scans are costly or impractical-especially for long pulses, wavelength regimes with limited spectrometer coverage (e.g., UV), or hardware with coarse resolution, yielding severely undersampled FROG traces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle in this regime-iterative algorithms are computationally heavy, convolutional networks blur fine structure, and sequence models are unstable when inputs are discontinuous or sparse. We present a generative diffusion framework tailored to recover ultrafast pulse intensity and phase from incomplete FROG measurements. Our model infers missing spectro-temporal content with high fidelity, enabling accurate retrieval from aggressively downsampled inputs. On a simulated benchmark of FROG-pulse pairs, the diffusion approach surpasses strong CNN and Seq2Seq baselines in accuracy and stability while remaining efficient enough for near real-time deployment."}

Although topological invariants, such as crossings and linking numbers, are fundamentally invariant, recent studies reveal that their observed values deteriorate considerably in turbulent conditions due to environmental effects. In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the predicted shape stability holds in real-world conditions. This study stablishes the shape of the singularities' lines as a scalable and resilient alternative for structured light tracing and transmission, opening new avenues for turbulence-robust-applications."}

In this study, we propose a novel spectroscopic approach to directly detect the geometric phase using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) enhanced by strong light-matter interactions within an optical cavity. Focusing on a prototypical pentacene dimer undergoing singlet fission, we model the nonadiabatic wave packet dynamics as it evolves through a CI between electronically excited states. The optical cavity enables dynamic modulation of the coupling between the optical field and molecular vibrational modes, allowing precise control over the wave packet pathways. Importantly, we identify a cancellation in the spectral amplitude, arising from phase differences accumulated along different trajectories, which serves as a clear spectroscopic manifestation of the geometric phase (GP). This cavity-enhanced 2DES framework not only enables direct observation of GP effects but also offers a versatile platform for probing ultrafast nonadiabatic processes. Our results provide fundamental insights into topological effects in molecular dynamics and pave the way for experimental strategies in quantum control, photochemistry, and the design of advanced optoelectronic materials."}

In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets. These results provide a robust framework for scalable $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/diamond integration in thermally resilient high power and RF device technologies."}

Although their light effective mass and strong Coulomb binding favour high transition temperatures, convincing demonstrations of pure-exciton condensation have hitherto been limited to cryogenic conditions. Here, we report the direct observation of quasi-equilibrium condensation of dark excitons in monolayer tungsten diselenide at 300 K and ambient pressure. We achieve this by creating nanoscale spacing-graded Stark traps to confine free excitons, setting the finite-size scale, non-resonant off-axis optical injection to control the local density-temperature trajectory, and employing surface plasmon polariton-enhanced microsphere-assisted microscopy to boost dark-exciton emission and directly image first-order spatial coherence with sub-diffraction resolution. We observe a sharp degeneracy threshold and a clear phase transition, evidenced by extended first-order spatial coherence with algebraic decay and a critical exponent consistent with the universal Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless criterion. Identical condensation signatures are observed in over 30 independent samples. Our work establishes a room-temperature excitonic platform for exploring strongly correlated many-body physics and advancing near-dissipationless, coherent quantum technologies."}

Submitted to \"npj 2D Materials and Applications\" on November 4, 2025", "summary": "Strain fundamentally alters carrier transport in semiconductors by modifying their band structure and scattering pathways. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an emerging class of 2D semiconductors, we show that mobility modulation under biaxial strain is dictated by changes in inter-valley scattering rather than effective mass renormalization as in bulk silicon. Using a multiscale full-band transport framework that incorporates both intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering, we find that tensile strain enhances n-type mobility through K-Q valley separation, while compressive strain improves p-type mobility via Γ-K decoupling. The tuning rates calculated from our full-band model far exceed those achieved by strain engineering in silicon. Both relaxed and strain-modulated carrier mobilities align quantitatively with experimentally verified measurements and are valid across a wide range of practical FET configurations. The enhancement remains robust across variations in temperature, carrier density, impurity level, and dielectric environment. Our results highlight the pivotal role of strain in improving the reliability and performance of 2D TMD-based electronics."}

By evaluating L band masing media under identical conditions, optimal doping levels and gain materials for high power operation are identified. The optimized system produced room temperature continuous wave masing with a peak output of 2.34 mW (+3.69 dBm), marking the first milliwatt level emission from an organic maser. Spectral coherence times of 465 ns and coherence lengths up to 150 m were obtained. Coupling to a high Q cavity mode enables collective spin photon interactions, with Rabi oscillations revealing coherent ensemble dynamics. Frequency domain analysis shows normal mode splitting of 1.37 MHz for Pc:PTP and 2.14 MHz for DAP:PTP, confirming strong coupling. Cavity QED analysis yields cooperativities C* = 304-803 for Pc:PTP and 405-1071 for DAP:PTP, among the highest for organic systems. Quantitative metrics of signal to noise ratio, spectral coherence distance, and throughput demonstrate the potential of these masers for radar, secure communication, and quantum interface technologies."}

Coherent microwave sources offer a compelling alternative for quantum-secure communication, yet their propagation outside enclosed resonators has remained untested. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature FS transmission of maser signals generated using organic L-band (1-2 GHz) gain media, pentacene doped p-terphenyl (Pc: PTP), and Diazapentacene-doped p-terphenyl (DAP:PTP). Spectral and temporal coherence is preserved over distances up to 25 cm, approximately one wavelength at the masing frequency. Tests included polarisation misalignment, high-humidity conditions, and partial occlusion by foliage to emulate realistic FS reception scenarios. Strong spin-photon coupling was maintained, as confirmed by persistent rabi oscillations and normal-mode splitting. An instantaneous peak output of 4.29 mW (+6.32 dBm) from a 0.01% DAP:PTP gain medium. with a pulse duration of ~4 μs, marks a performance benchmark for directly coupled masers.

To accelerate training, limited by the low refresh rate of SLMs, spatial multiplexing of the input data across different spatial channels is possible maximizing the number of available spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). Precise alignment is required in order to ensure that the same physical operation is performed across each channel. We present a semi-automatic procedure for this experimentally challenging alignment resulting in a pixel-level conjugation. It is scalable to any number of SLMs and may be useful in wavefront shaping setups where precise conjugation of SLMs is required, e.g. for the control of optical waves in phase and amplitude. The resulting setup functions as an optical DNN able to process hundreds of inputs simultaneously, thereby reducing training times and experimental noise through spatial averaging. We further present a characterization of the setup and an alignment method."}
