### [1] [Neural Network Model for OAM Crosstalk due to Turbulence-Induced Tilt and Lateral Displacement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03603)
*Mitchell A. Cox,Steven G. Makoni,Ling Cheng*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用前馈神经网络模型来模拟湍流环境中轨道角动量（OAM）模式串扰的方法，弥补了现有解析模型的不足，并通过实验验证了模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由空间光通信系统中，OAM模式的多路复用或分集技术受到湍流引起的倾斜/倾斜像差和横向位移的严重影响，准确建模OAM模式串扰是开发高效系统的关键。

Method: 采用前馈神经网络模型，考虑了倾斜像差和横向位移对任意输入OAM模式的影响，并通过双摄像头实验验证模型的准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型的均方根误差通常低于11%，能够可靠地估计湍流引起的模式串扰，为数字信号处理、软判决前向纠错或动态模式跳频提供元信息支持。

Conclusion: 该神经网络模型在模拟湍流环境中的OAM模式串扰方面具有较高的准确性和泛化能力，未来可应用于优化自由空间光通信系统的性能。

Abstract: Accurately modelling orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode crosstalk in
turbulent environments is challenging yet essential for developing free-space
optical systems that employ OAM modes for multiplexing or diversity. Turbulence
induces tip/tilt aberrations and lateral displacement, which significantly
degrade system performance. Existing analytical models describe the
transformation from an input Gaussian mode to an output OAM spectrum; however,
our feed forward neural network model generalizes this approach by accounting
for the effects of these aberrations on arbitrary input OAM modes. We validate
the model experimentally by estimating turbulence-induced tilt and lateral
displacement using a dual-camera setup and comparing the estimated spectrum
with the actual modal decomposition. With a typical root mean square error of
less than 11%, our results indicate that the model could serve as a reliable
source of meta-information for digital signal processing, soft-decision forward
error correction or perhaps dynamic mode hopping in future systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种抗湍流的端到端自由空间光通信系统（TRFSO），结合数据驱动的信道模型和联合源信道编码调制（JSCCM），以增强系统在湍流条件下的鲁棒性。通过双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）模型模拟实际信道失真，显著提升了传输性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自由空间光通信（FSO）是下一代通信网络的潜在解决方案，但其性能受到大气湍流的显著影响。为了提高系统在湍流条件下的鲁棒性，作者提出了一种新的方法，通过数据驱动的信道模型和联合编码调制技术来优化通信质量。

Method: 作者开发了一种基于双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）的信道模型，该模型通过在实际FSO链路上收集的数据进行训练，以准确捕捉湍流条件下的信道失真。同时，系统采用了联合源信道编码调制（JSCCM）技术，进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 提出的TRFSO系统在动态大气湍流条件下能够实现稳健且可靠的传输，证明了数据驱动信道模型与联合编码调制技术的有效性。

Abstract: Free space optical (FSO) communication is considered a promising solution in
next_generation communication networks. However, its performance is
significantly influenced by atmospheric turbulence. To enhance system
robustness to turbulence, we propose a turbulence_robust end_to_end FSO
communication system (TRFSO) that integrates a data-driven channel model with
joint source_channel coding modulation (JSCCM). Specifically, a bidirectional
long short-term memory (BiLSTM)_based channel model is developed and trained on
data collected over a physical FSO link under varying turbulence conditions.
This model accurately captures real_world channel distortions, achieving a
minimum Kullback_Leibler (KL) divergence of 0.0019 in amplitude distribution
matching. Experimental results show that the TRFSO system trained with the
BiLSTM_based channel model outperforms the same architecture trained under the
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, achieving an average 3.5 dB
improvement in multi-scale structural similarity (MS_SSIM) under strong
atmospheric turbulence. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed TRFSO in achieving robust and reliable transmission under dynamic
atmospheric turbulence.

TL;DR: 论文展示了一种基于双层复合电极的液晶（LC）透镜阵列，具有大孔径、短焦距和低工作电压的特点。通过优化电场分布，该设计实现了2D/3D可切换显示，并具备优异的制造容错性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统液晶透镜阵列在实现大孔径（800μm或更大）时面临的技术挑战，如高工作电压、焦距限制以及制造误差敏感性问题。

Method: 采用双层复合电极层设计，包括像素电极和辅助电极。在聚焦模式下，像素电极接收工作电压以建立电场，辅助电极施加较低电压以优化电场分布。同时，通过氧化物层和较厚的LC层实现理想的折射率分布。

Abstract: A liquid crystal (LC) lens array based on double-layer composite electrodes,
characterized by a large aperture, short focal length, and low operating
voltage is demonstrated. The lens array consists of an LC layer, a top common
electrode, a bottom double-layer composite electrode layer, and an oxide layer.
The bottom double-layer composite electrode layer comprises the pixel
electrodes and the auxiliary electrode. In focusing mode, the pixel electrodes
receive operational voltage to establish the LC layer's electric field, with
the auxiliary electrode applying reduced voltage for field optimization.
Experiment results show that the proposed LC lens array achieves the shortest
focal length of 3.3 mm when the pixel electrodes are set at 5.2 Vrms and the
auxiliary electrode is set at 2.6 Vrms. This design addresses the technical
challenge of achieving larger apertures (800 {\mu}m or more), offering enhanced
viewing zones and improved 3D performance. This configuration provides an ideal
refractive index distribution in a relatively thick LC layer, enabling 2D/3D
switchable display with performance superior to current LC lens arrays of
equivalent aperture. Furthermore, the proposed structure demonstrates excellent
tolerance to manufacturing errors.

Abstract: Sensitive to scattering from unresolved sample structures, the dark-field
channel in full-field X-ray imaging provides complementary information to that
offered by conventional attenuation and phase-contrast methods. A range of
experimental dark-field techniques and retrieval algorithms have been recently
developed to extract this signal by directly resolving dark-field-associated
local image blurring with a high-resolution camera. While the underlying
physical mechanism that generates dark-field contrast is generally defined
similarly across the methods, no comparison of these dark-field techniques
using identical samples has been conducted. In this paper, dark-field imaging
data from two samples were acquired using three emerging dark-field setups at a
synchrotron: propagation-based, single-grid, and speckle-based X-ray imaging.
Dark-field images were then reconstructed using a variety of retrieval
algorithms--some requiring only a single sample exposure, others multiple; some
performing local, pixel-wise analysis, and others operating globally on entire
images. We find that the dominant contribution to dark-field contrast--arising
from diffuse scattering from unresolved microstructures or multiple refractions
through larger, potentially resolved structures--is consistently recovered
across all approaches, demonstrating mutual agreement. However, some
differences emerge for structures that are spatially varying. We attribute
these differences to the idea that each technique has a different internal
ruler, a sensitivity scale for dark-field retrieval influenced by both the
experimental design and algorithmic assumptions of the technique. This study is
intended to guide dark-field imaging users in selecting the most appropriate
technique for their imaging goals and to motivate future research into
dark-field sensitivity and sources of dark-field contrast across different
methods.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two-step photon upconversion solar cells (TPU-SCs) belong to the class of
solar cells that in principle can exceed the Shockley--Queisser limit for
single-junction solar cells. A TPU-SC basically consists of a wide-gap and a
narrow-gap semiconductor layer, where intraband absorption of infrared (IR)
photons by electrons accumulated at the conduction-band-edge discontinuity
leads to an increase in the output current and voltage. This IR-induced
upconversion process enables a better utilization of the broad solar spectrum,
and quantum dots (QDs) can be added to improve the intraband transition rates
in actual devices. In this study, we added an n--p--n double-tunnel-junction
structure to an $\mathrm{Al_{0.3}Ga_{0.7}As}$/GaAs TPU-SC including a QD layer
to further enhance the contribution of intraband absorption to the output
current. The double-tunnel-junction structure should suppress carrier
recombination at the heterointerface and improve the extraction efficiency of
electrons after intraband absorption. We performed two-color excitation
experiments using IR and 784-nm light, and we particularly found that 784-nm
light causes a significant amount of intraband transitions in this device. By
employing rate equations, we clarify that this result demonstrates a higher
intraband absorption efficiency due to the double-tunnel-junction structure.
This highlights the potential of double-tunnel-junction structures for the
realization of high-efficiency TPU-SCs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless networks require dynamic spectrum
management to optimize the utilization of scarce spectral resources and support
emerging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) applications. This
necessitates real-time spectrum sensing (RT-SS) capability with ultrawide
measurement range, compact size, and low latency. Conventional electronic RT-SS
solutions face critical challenges in operating across the millimeter-wave and
sub-terahertz bands, which are essential spectra for 6G wireless. While
photonic RT-SS has the potential to surpass this limitation, the current
implementations feature limited bandwidths below 50 GHz and mostly rely on
bulky dispersive fibers with high latency. Here, we address these challenges by
developing an integrated photonic RT-SS system capable of ultrabroadband
measurement from microwave to sub-terahertz bands, covering the full spectrum
for 6G wireless. The photonic RT-SS circuit integrates a broadband
electro-optic (EO) modulator for unknown signal loading, an EO tunable
microring filter bank for high-speed parallel frequency-to-time mapping, as
well as an EO comb for precise channel frequency referencing, all realized on a
single thin-film lithium niobate chip. We achieve an unprecedented spectral
measurement range beyond 120 GHz at a low latency of less than 100 ns. To
validate the effectiveness of our photonic RT-SS system in future 6G scenes, we
further propose a heuristic spectro-temporal resource allocation algorithm and
conduct a proof-of-concept ISAC demonstration, where a radar adaptively access
RT-SS-informed spectrally underutilized regions for high-quality target sensing
under dynamic communication interferences. Our work presents a compact and
cost-effective solution for efficient spectrum sharing and dynamic management
in future 6G ISAC networks.

### [7] [Normalized Ensemble-Averaged OAM Spectrum in Disordered Statistical Q-Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03920)
*Netzer Moriya*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 本文通过解析推导和蒙特卡罗模拟，研究了高斯光束通过具有高斯空间无序性的统计Q板时，其轨道角动量（OAM）功率谱的统计行为，并提出了一种新的通用标度框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在解决关于高斯光束在无序介质中传播时，其OAM功率谱的统计行为问题。这一问题在复杂介质中传播的光子或波的OAM应用（如通信、成像等）中具有重要意义。具体而言，作者希望揭示无序性对OAM模态的影响，并为不同无序强度下的行为提供统一描述。

Method: 作者采用了解析推导和数值模拟结合的方法。首先，利用高斯矩定理，推导出一个新的闭式表达式，描述平均互相关性。然后，将这一相关性函数严格投影到OAM模态上，得到一个完全归一化的级数表示，并证明了其绝对收敛性。作者还分析了无序性的极限情况（粗无序和细无序）。此外，提出了一个由主控参数和通用坐标定义的标度框架，通过蒙特卡罗模拟验证了这一框架的预测结果。

Result: 研究发现，粗无序情况下，OAM功率谱呈现理想的单峰分布，集中于标称OAM模式；而在细无序情况下，部分功率随无序方差指数衰减，并分布于邻近OAM模式，其有效宽度与无量纲关联长度成反比。提出的标度框架统一了所有无序强度下的OAM功率谱描述，并通过模拟验证了其普适性。

Conclusion: 本文通过严格的解析推导和模拟验证，全面分析了无序性对OAM功率谱的影响，并提出了一种新的通用标度框架。这一框架不仅统一了不同无序强度下的光谱行为描述，还为复杂介质中OAM应用提供了理论基础。未来研究可以基于此框架进一步探索其他无序介质中的OAM行为。

Abstract: This work presents an exact, analytical derivation of the ensemble-averaged
orbital angular momentum (OAM) power spectrum for a circularly polarized
Gaussian beam traversing a statistical Q-plate with Gaussian spatial disorder.
Utilizing the Gaussian moment theorem, a new closed-form expression for the
averaged mutual coherence is obtained. This coherence function is then
rigorously projected onto OAM modes, yielding an exactly normalized series
representation whose absolute convergence is formally proven. The analysis
meticulously resolves limiting disorder regimes: for coarse disorder, an ideal
OAM spectrum, sharply peaked at its nominal OAM mode, is demonstrated.
Conversely, for fine disorder, a specific fraction of total power exponentially
decays with disorder variance into the nominal OAM mode, with remaining power
distributed among nearby OAM modes, exhibiting an effective width inversely
proportional to the dimensionless correlation length. Crucially, a new
universal scaling framework, defined by a master control parameter and a
universal coordinate, is introduced. This framework, rigorously derived from
the exact solution, unifies the spectrum's description across all relevant
disorder regimes and enables robust data collapse. Monte Carlo simulations,
implemented with the same normalization and OAM projection, substantiate these
claims by corroborating the predicted scaling and universal behavior, offering
a foundational, device-level perspective on OAM universality in complex media.

Abstract: Skyrmions are topologically stable vector textures as potential information
carriers for high-density data storage and communications, especially boosted
by the recently emerging meta-generators of skyrmions in electromagnetic
fields. However, these implementations always rely on planar, rigid designs
with stringent fabrication requirements. Here, we propose the free-form
conformal metasurface generating skyrmions towards future wearable and flexible
devises for topological resilience light fields. Furthermore, we experimentally
tested the outstanding topological robustness of the skyrmion number under
different disorder degrees on the metasurface. This work promotes the
development of flexible compact skyrmion-based communication devices and
demonstrates their potential to improve the quality of space information
transmission.

Abstract: We report a mid-infrared ring laser via fiber-to-waveguide hybrid integration
enabled by directional couplers fabricated in fluoride glasses. Directional
couplers were inscribed into fluoride glass using femtosecond laser direct
writing, forming low-loss waveguides with a high positive refractive index
change. The waveguides were optimized for efficient guidance at a wavelength of
2.7 {\textmu}m. Directional couplers with systematically varied coupling gap
and interaction lengths were fabricated and experimentally characterized,
demonstrating controllable power splitting ratios spanning from complete
transmission (100:0) to balanced coupling (50:50). A directional coupler with a
7 {\textmu}m coupling gap and a 1.5 mm interaction length, providing an 80:20
power splitting ratio, was integrated with a cladding-pumped Er:ZBLAN fiber to
realize a ring laser cavity. The resulting device produced stable lasing at
2716.7 nm with an output power of 14.2 mW. This work represents the first
realization of a fully fiber-chip integrated mid-infrared laser source and
opens new avenues for 3D photonic integration in fluoride glasses, enabling
design flexibility previously unattainable in traditional fiber-optics

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although speckle is a powerful tool for high-precision metrology, large
datasets and cumbersome training are always required to learn from the encoded
speckle patterns, which is unfavorable for rapid deployment and
multi-dimensional metrology. To enable high accuracy and fast training,
physics-informed machine learning enforces physical laws to address
high-dimensional problems. Here, we harness the modal fields in a few-mode
fiber, which follow the law of beam propagation, to enable high-accuracy and
fast-training parameter estimation. Anti-noise fast mode decomposition is
implemented to retrieve the modal fields from the speckles. The accuracy is
enhanced since the modal fields enable parameter estimation at random points in
the continuous space-time domain. Artificial tactile perception and
multi-dimensional metrology are achieved with high accuracy because the modal
fields respond diversely to different parameters. Meanwhile, the number of
specklegrams for training is reduced by around 5 times. The training time of
machine learning is significantly reduced by 800 times, from 9 hours and 45
minutes to 40 seconds. Therefore, harnessing the modal fields paves a new way
for the speckle-based metrology to develop efficient, low-cost,
multi-dimensional sensors, making it suitable for intelligent wearable devices,
industrial robots and healthcare applications.

Conclusion: 本文证明了AlGaAs (111)平面光学平台在量子光源中的潜力，其高效的光子对生成和低背景特性使其成为可扩展量子光子源的有力候选。同时，隐藏偏振效应的观测为非经典偏振效应的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Flat-optics platforms offer new opportunities for the generation of entangled
photons by relaxing traditional phase-matching constraints, enabling the use of
a broader range of nonlinear materials. Among these, gallium arsenide and
aluminum gallium arsenide stand out for their exceptionally high second-order
nonlinearities, but their conventional orientation (001) has limited their
applicability for photon-pair generation. By transitioning to crystals with
(111) surface orientation, we overcome these limitations. We demonstrate a
flat-optics-based telecom-range SPDC source using Al0.30Ga0.70As that achieves
a high photon-pair generation rate per pump power and bandwidth of up to 0.24
Hz/mW/nm. The choice of 30% aluminum concentration allowed us to reduce pump
absorption and photoluminescence background for photon pairs generation at
telecom wavelengths by at least an order of magnitude compared to that of GaAs.
The specific layer orientation facilitates the generation of orthogonally
polarized entangled photons, a prerequisite for polarization-entangled states.
Rather than directly probing entanglement, we observe the effect of hidden
polarization. Our results highlight AlGaAs (111) as a promising platform for
scalable quantum photonic sources and shed light on nonclassical polarization
effects accessible through flat-optics engineering.

Abstract: Biophotonics-and more recently, biointegrated photonics-offer transformative
tools for probing cellular processes with unprecedented precision. Among these,
whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators-optical microcavities formed in
spherical structures-have emerged as powerful biosensors and intracellular
barcodes. Lipid droplets (LDs), with their high refractive index and intrinsic
spherical geometry, are ideal candidates for supporting intracellular lasing.
Although lasing in LDs has been previously demonstrated, it has not yet been
harnessed to study live cell biology. Here, we report the first use of WGM
resonances in LDs of live primary adipocytes, employing a continuous-wave (CW)
laser at powers below the biological damage threshold. By measuring these
resonances, we achieved nanometer-scale precision in size estimation, enabling
real-time observation of rapid LD dynamics and deformations on the minute
scale, far beyond the spatio-temporal resolution of conventional microscopy. We
systematically characterized this photonic sensing approach, demonstrating its
ability to resolve adipocyte heterogeneity, monitor lipolytic responses to
forskolin and isoproterenol, and detect early signs of cell viability loss,
well before conventional assays. This proof-of-concept establishes
intracellular LD WGM resonances as a robust platform for investigating live
single-cell metabolism. The technique enables rapid, cost-effective assessment
of adipocyte function, reveals cell-to-cell variability obscured by bulk
assays, and lays the foundation for high-throughput analysis of metabolism- and
obesity-related diseases at both cellular and tissue levels.

Abstract: A phononic frequency comb consists of equally spaced components in the
mechanical frequency domain and holds promise for numerous applications. Yet,
prior demonstrations have been limited in spectral range due to the inherently
low mechanical frequencies. In this work, we report a phononic comb with a
record span from 1 to 70 GHz. This result is achieved by harnessing the strong
mechanical nonlinearity of a $2.5$-$\mu$m-radius silicon carbide microdisk,
which supports a radial breathing mode at $1.655$ GHz with a mechanical quality
factor of 13,500. With just 1 mW of dropped optical power, radiation pressure
from a continuous-wave pump drives strong phonon lasing, generating 42
phase-locked harmonics with $1.655$ GHz spacing. The combination of such broad
bandwidth, low phase noise (-132 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency) and
frequency stability ($<10^{-7}$ at 1 second of averaging time) positions this
ultracompact phononic comb as a powerful platform for diverse applications.

ScAlN with Platinum (Pt) electrodes was demonstrated at 11.7 GHz with a 3 dB
fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 4.0% and an out of band rejection greater than
23.1 dB. However, the filter exhibits a moderate insertion loss (IL) of 6.8 dB,
which is attributed to a limited Quality (Q) factor in the constituent
resonators. Consequently, we identify and analyze three primary challenges in
frequency scaling ScAlN FBARs with thinner film stacks: 1) degradation of
piezoelectric thin-film crystal quality, 2) increased series resistance in
ultra-thin electrodes, and 3) residual film stress that limits device size and
structural integrity. By establishing a clear relationship between these
fabrication-level challenges and the resulting device performance, this work
provides critical insights for the future development of low-loss acoustic
filters for millimeter-wave applications.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena are generally governed by geometry in matter
systems, as they depend on the spatial arrangement of atoms within materials or
molecules. Metasurfaces, through precisely designed geometries on a
subwavelength scale, allow tailoring the optical response of a material far
beyond its natural properties. Therefore, metasurfaces are highly appealing to
enable the engineering of nonlinear optical interactions at an unprecedented
level. Current studies on nonlinear metasurfaces predominantly focus on the
phase control of the generated light. Nonetheless, investigating the tensorial
nature of the nonlinearity of metasurfaces and its effect on the polarization
of the generated light is critical to fully unlock a range of applications,
such as nonlinear vector beam generation and nonlinear polarization imaging.
Here, we study the artificial optical nonlinearity of a dielectric metasurface
originating from its meta-atom symmetry and describe the third-order nonlinear
behavior by considering the polarization degree of freedom. We establish an
effective nonlinear medium model that serves as a design toolbox for developing
amorphous silicon-based geometric metasurfaces with customizable features in
third harmonic generation. We further extract quantitative values of the
artificial nonlinear susceptibility tensor elements related to the investigated
nonlinear process and geometry. The implemented functional devices demonstrate
the versatility of dielectric metasurfaces in shaping the emitted light in
terms of amplitude, phase, and polarization, for the precise engineering of
novel nonlinear architectures targeting applications in nonlinear imaging and
complex light generation.

Abstract: Graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) are among the most promising
platforms for ultrasensitive chemical and biological sensing due to their high
carrier mobility, large surface area, and low intrinsic noise. However,
conventional single-gate GFET sensors in liquid environments suffer from severe
limitations, including signal drift, charge trapping, and insufficient signal
amplification. Here, we introduce a dual-gate GFET architecture that integrates
a high-k hafnium dioxide local back gate with an electrolyte top gate, coupled
with real-time feedback biasing. This design enables capacitive signal
amplification while simultaneously suppressing gate leakage and low-frequency
noise. By systematically evaluating seven distinct operational modes, we
identify the Dual Mode Fixed configuration as optimal, achieving up to 20x
signal gain, > 15x lower drift compared with gate-swept methods, and up to 7x
higher signal to noise ratio across a diverse range of analytes, including
neurotransmitters, volatile organic compounds, environmental contaminants, and
proteins. We further demonstrate robust, multiplexed detection using a
PCB-integrated GFET sensor array, underscoring the scalability and practicality
of the platform for portable, high-throughput sensing in complex environments.
Together, these advances establish a versatile and stable sensing technology
capable of real-time, label-free detection of molecular targets under ambient
and physiological conditions, with broad applicability in health monitoring,
food safety, agriculture, and environmental screening.

Abstract: Heat propagation is governed by phonon interactions and mathematically
described by partial differential equations (PDEs), which link thermal
transport to the intrinsic properties of materials. Conventional experimental
techniques infer thermal responses based on surface emissions, limiting their
ability to fully resolve subsurface structures and internal heat distribution.
Additionally, existing thermal tomographic techniques can only shoot one frame
from each layer. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged
as powerful tools for solving inverse problems in heat transfer by integrating
observational data with physical constraints. However, standard PINNs are
primarily focused on fitting the given external temperature data, without
explicit knowledge of the unknown internal temperature distribution. In this
study, we introduce a Helmholtz-informed neural network (HINN) to predict
internal temperature distributions without requiring internal measurements. The
time-domain heat diffusion equation was converted to the frequency-domain and
becomes the pseudo-Helmholtz equation. HINN embeds this pseudo-Helmholtz
equation into the learning framework, leveraging both real and imaginary
components of the thermal field. Finally, an inverse Fourier transform brings
real-part and imagery-part back to the time-domain and can be used to map 3D
thermal fields with interior defects. Furthermore, a truncated operation was
conducted to improve computational efficiency, and the principle of conjugate
symmetry was employed for repairing the discarded data. This approach
significantly enhances predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Our
results demonstrate that HINN outperforms state-of-the-art PINNs and inverse
heat solvers, offering a novel solution for non-invasive thermography in
applications spanning materials science, biomedical diagnostics, and
nondestructive evaluation.

Abstract: Photo-thermal methods for measuring thermal diffusivity inherently pose an
ill-posed inverse problem, affected by factors such as sample thickness,
heating or cooling time, and excitation energy. Measurement accuracy becomes
particularly challenging under non-impulsive pulsed excitation when the
observation timescale is comparable to the pulse duration. This is often due to
poorly defined pulse shapes, broadened thermal responses, and the absence of
clear boundary conditions, especially under significant interfacial temperature
gradients where natural convection dominates. The classic Parker solution,
while widely used, is physically unrealistic as it assumes adiabatic heat flux
and shallow-region heat absorption. In this study, we prove that Parker's
assumption is equivalent to the Dirac pulse boundary condition in mathematics.
Then, we present comprehensive analytical solutions for thermal/cooling
responses under Dirac and rectangular pulse excitations. By comparing with
eigenfunction-based solutions for well-posed boundary conditions, we show that
Parker's solution is only valid before the thermal peak. Through dimensionless
processing, we further demonstrate that Parker's solution can be regarded as a
limiting case of the rectangular pulse solution as the heating duration
approaches zero. Furthermore, we propose a novel excitation approach,
evaporative cryocooling, for thermal diffusivity measurement. This method
offers a compact, low-cost, and easy-to-implement alternative to conventional
excitation schemes. The theoretical model was further validated through
comparison with experimental results.

Abstract: The prompt identification of pancreatic cancer symptoms is an ongoing
clinical challenge, often leading to late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Tumor
'hijacking' of the pancreatic stromal structure limits the uptake of systemic
chemotherapeutics. Localized drug delivery systems (DDS) using endoluminal
techniques are widely utilized, with positive early results for improved
control over tumor growth. There is a need for technologies that integrate
endoluminal resources and intelligent material systems to better control the
spatiotemporal delivery of chemotherapeutics. We demonstrate the ultrasound
(US)-triggered localized release of therapeutics through the design of solvent
traceless drug-loaded vinylbenzyl-functionalized gelatin (gel4vbc)
nanoparticles (NPs) integrated with an electrospun fabric. Albumin-loaded NPs
encapsulated into a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coating of a
poly(epsilon-caprolactone) fabric evidence tunable triggered NP delivery
controlled by regulating PVA concentration (0-1 wt.%) and US intensity (0-3
W/cm2). The fixation of the NP-coated fabric to a magnetic tentacle robot (MTR)
enables the automated manipulation into a phantom pancreatic duct before the
US-triggered release of NP-loaded albumin and MTR retraction. Albumin release
is controlled by varying the surface area of the NP-loaded MTR-coating fabric.
Herein we have designed a novel DDS capable of facile integration into soft
robotics and US-triggered delivery of therapeutic-loaded NPs.
