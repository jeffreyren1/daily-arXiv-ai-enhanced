Graphene, with its c-axis orientation and\nwell-defined interlayer spacing, exhibits electron interference effects that\ncan influence the properties of emitted electrons. In this work, motion of an\nelectron wave packet is numerically calculated to discuss the energy spread of\nthe zero-order and first-order diffracted electron waves by mono- and\nmultilayer graphene. It is found that the effects of multiple reflections of\nelectron between the layers broaden the energy spread especially for the\nincident energy of 13.4 eV, and that highly monochromatic electron emission can\nbe achieved by using diffracted electron wave with a small aperture."}

To achieve this, we introduce a \\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch in the\ninput network, comprising a transmission line, a capacitor (\\textit{C$_{B}$})\nand a resistor (\\textit{R$_{V}$}). The sensor is tested with eight different\nliquids with different dielectric constants, including water, IV fluid, milk,\nethanol, acetone, petrol, olive oil, and Vaseline. By fine-tuning the\n\\textit{Z$_{2}$} branch, a clear relationship is found between\n$\\varepsilon_{r}$ of materials and R$_{V}$.Our experimental results demonstrate\noutstanding characteristics, including remarkable linearity (nonlinearity <\n2.44\\%), high accuracy with an average sensitivity of 21 kHz/$\\mu$m, and an\nexcellent limit of detection (LoD < 0.05 mm). The sensor also exhibits good\nstability across a range of liquid temperatures and shows robust and repeatable\nbehavior. Considering the strong absorption of microwave energy in liquids with\nhigh dielectric constants, this oscillator sensor is a superior choice over\ncapacitive sensors for such applications. We validate the performance of the\noscillator sensor using water as a representative liquid.

Its advantages, including affordability, compatibility\nwith CMOS and MEMS technologies, and ease of fabrication, make it an excellent\nchoice for small-scale liquid detection applications."}

This effect can\nsignificantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real\nmeasurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration\nparameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure\namplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient.\nThese parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure\nconditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference.\nExperimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated\nparameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors,\nsignificantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex\nforeground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach\nprovides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex\nhardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and\nrobustness across a wide range of real-world applications."}

In this work, we extend the measurable film-thickness range of\nreflectometry to at least 50 um through a new model-free algorithm, the\nLinearized Reflectance Zero-Crossing (LRZ) method. The approach builds upon the\npreviously reported Linearized Reflectance Extrema (LRE) technique but\neliminates the sensitivity to spectral sampling and fringe attenuation that\ndegrade performance in the thick-film regime. By linearizing phase response and\nextracting zero-crossing positions in wavenumber space, LRZ provides robust and\nrepeatable thickness estimation without iterative fitting, achieving comparable\naccuracy with much higher computational efficiency than conventional\nmodel-based methods. Validation using more than 80 measurements on alumina\nfilms over NiFe substrates shows excellent correlation with WLI (r = 0.97) and\nlow gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R < 3%). Moreover, LRZ achieves\nan average Move-Acquire-Measure (MAM) time of approximately 2 s, which is about\n7 times faster than WLI.

Nonlinear optical processes\nin microresonators require both large quality factors to promote build-up of\nlarge intracavity powers and sufficient control over resonator dispersion to\nimplement phase-matching, which is generally achieved through careful design\nand fabrication of the resonator cross-sectional dimensions. Additionally,\ngenerating dissipative Kerr soliton optical frequency combs requires operation\nin the anomalous dispersion regime, which calls for such thick layers of SiN as\nto make achieving accuracy during etching a challenge. In this work, we\ninvestigate the relationship between fabrication process details, including\nlithography and etching, and optical properties, such as optical loss and\nresonator dispersion, for two different subtractive fabrication approaches: one\nutilizing a polymer-based electron beam resist as the protective mask during\netching and the other employing a thin metallic etch-mask. Using both\napproaches, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of polymer and metal\netch-masks, determine the origins of optical loss through variations in\nelectron beam lithography parameters, and connect resonator sidewall roughness\nto optical loss.
