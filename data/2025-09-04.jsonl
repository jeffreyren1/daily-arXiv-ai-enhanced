Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop\nrods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation\nthrough folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities. Previous studies have\nshown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural\ncurvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar\nring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations.

Due to\nnatural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring\nspontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration.\nThese snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable\nself-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of\ncomplex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design\nof functional deployable and foldable structures. By combining a multi-segment\nKirchhoff rod model with finite element simulations and experiments, we\nsystematically investigate the 3D equilibrium states and transition behavior of\nthese systems.

Traditional\non-chip photonic (de)multiplexing requires large device footprint for\nmaintaining high efficiency, large operation bandwidth, and small insertion\nlosses. Here a hybrid inverse design method is therefore proposed to combine\ngenetic algorithms (GA) and topology optimization for developing an\nultracompact (lateral size< 2{\\lambda}) terahertz (THz)\nmode-/wavelength-division demultiplexer (MDM-WDM). The method leverages the\nglobal search capability of GA in continuous parameter spaces and the local\ntopology optimization strategy driven by the adjoint method, effectively\nimproving design convergence efficiency and global performance robustness.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the device simultaneously achieves stable\nthree-channel MDM and WDM with insertion loss (IL) of less than 3 dB and\ninter-channel crosstalk (CT) can be -22 dB. The output achieves spatial\nseparation of the orthogonal TE10, TE20, and TE30 modes that correspond to\nthree central wavelengths {\\lambda}1~690 {\\mu}m, {\\lambda}2~700 {\\mu}m, and\n{\\lambda}3~710 {\\mu}m, respectively, verifying the device's precise control\nover target modes and wavelengths. This work provides an efficient optimization\napproach for developing broadband, multichannel, and highly integrated THz\nmultiplexing devices, offering new pathways for constructing next-generation\nintegrated photonic interconnects and signal processing systems."}

This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also\nquantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that\ngravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different\nto the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry.\nExperiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is\nquantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of\ngravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A\npathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal\nfirst using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be\nnanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can\nsubsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nThis is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental\nprogress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a\nmedium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including\nvibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress\nand plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will\nfurther explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which\nwill test theories that predict a limit to this."}

We analyze three local\nnoise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength\nof each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of\nthe quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and\nstored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but\nstabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster\ncharging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel\ncombines both features.
