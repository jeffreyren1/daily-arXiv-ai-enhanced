As the amplitudes of the incident spin waves increase, the edge mode exhibits a positive nonlinear frequency shift.

Here, we overcome these limitations by synthesizing 2D single crystal ErOCl that has an Er density of 1.75*1022 cm-3. The high-quality single crystal material significantly reduces the density-related quenching effect that dominates in randomly doped materials with high Er concentration. This results in a record optical gain coefficient over 1500 dB/cm at 1536 nm band, at least larger by an order of magnitude than the previous gain record in Er materials. Leveraging this exceptional gain medium, we demonstrate room-temperature continuous-wave lasing operation by integrating with a photonic crystal microcavity, achieving a record-low threshold of 7 μW with the most compact size of any Er-based lasers. Furthermore, the unique Stark splitting characteristics of ErOCl provide optical gain in three wavelength bands and lead to lasing in these wavelengths by engineering the cavity. This is the first time that optical gain has been shown in three different wavelength bands in Er materials, together with the smallest size of laser cavity, could have many important applications in on-chip sensing and optical communication."}

Each segment covers one surface and the distance to the subsequent surface. Surface contributions represent the change of the wavefront that occurs due to propagation through individual segments.

Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies.

The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations.

This produces significantly higher fidelity and robustness than Gerchberg_Saxton type algorithms. Experimentally, we demonstrate H, V, L, and R polarized tweezer arrays using a single layer metasurface.

We design both achiral and chiral meta-cavities that support QBICs in the form of vortex states with high Q-factors. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the QBICs in the achiral meta-cavities cannot enhance acoustic HD due to the absence of a chiral wavefront. In contrast, the chiral meta-cavity exhibits a pronounced HD enhancement through the QBICs with a 3D helical wavefront, which can be excited by incident waves either with or without OAM. Our work identifies two essential requirements for enhancing acoustic HD effect via QBICs: a high Q-factor of the states and 3D chirality of the state fields, which usually compromise each other in conventional acoustic resonators.

Here, we introduce a non-invasive near-field modulation scheme where a metal plate approaches the filament at submillimeter distances (comparable to THz wavelengths), perturbing the dielectric environment to convert the symmetric annular THz mode into an asymmetric state. This controlled transition enables far-field detection of broadband calculus behaviors (first- and second-order differentiation/integration) on time-domain THz waveforms and characteristic spectral transfer functions with 1/f, 1/f^2, f or f^2 dependency (where f is the THz frequency), thereby diagnosing the near-field THz mode confinement. Hence, the proposed approach synergizes near-field modulation efficiency with far-field detection robustness, advancing fundamental understanding of plasma-THz interactions and enabling novel all-optical signal processing for filament-based THz technologies."}

Arising from local rules, these structures exhibit advanced optical functionalities, such as photonic band gaps, without relying on in-situ optimization or top-down design. Inspired by biological morphogenesis, we introduce an optimization-free approach for the automated generation of self-organized freeform waveguides that adapt to complex propagation paths. Our method relies on local reaction-diffusion dynamics to produce robust, spatially distributed structures. In contrast to conventional waveguides based on periodic media, which impose strong geometric constraints and require extensive fine-tuning, the proposed structures support nontrivial geometries while maintaining photonic band gap behavior. We experimentally demonstrate that these self-organized waveguides achieve superior transmission efficiency along complex paths. This optimization-free strategy enables the automated design of advanced electromagnetic components with intrinsic adaptability and resilience."}

Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing."}

While persistent photoconductivity (PPC) and gate-voltage (VG)-induced electron trapping are well-known phenomena in oxide heterostructures, their mutual coupling remains poorly explored. Here, we report that the non-equilibrium state established by PPC can effectively modulate the efficacy of VG-induced electron trapping in a STO/Al heterostructure. The PPC, characterized by a slow relaxation (8.5 hours at 4 K) after sub-illumination, originates from the re-trapping of photoexcited carriers into deep-level states. In contrast, VG-induced trapping, governed by shallow states, exhibits much faster dynamics ({100 - 400 s). Crucially, we discover that the strength of VG-induced trapping is not constant but is dynamically modulated by the PPC relaxation process. The trapping amplitude is strongly amplified after illumination and recovers only after the deep-level states are substantially refilled, precisely following the PPC relaxation time constant. Furthermore, the electron trapping effect diminishes with increasing temperature and vanishes near the ferroelastic phase transition of STO (110 K), confirming that ferroelastic twin walls and associated oxygen vacancy clusters are the physical origin of the traps. Our findings reveal a novel optical gating mechanism for electron trapping, paving the way for designing non-volatile, optically programmable electronic devices."}

These materials enable simultaneous optical thermometry and electroluminescence, with LIR values showing excellent agreement with external thermocouple measurements over a broad temperature range. OLED devices incorporating these complexes demonstrate stable operation, and their luminescence properties are further enhanced by integration with engineered plasmonic metasurfaces. This integration leads to a significant increase in emission directionality and a reduction of the excited-state lifetime via Purcell enhancement, without compromising spectral integrity. Our findings highlight the promise of lanthanide-based coordination compounds as multifunctional emitters for next-generation optoelectronic devices and suggest new pathways toward intelligent OLED architectures with integrated sensing and directional control."}

A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems."}

We extend its applicability to smaller ice crystals, combining rigorous modelling of particle shapes with the Phase Field Modelling and light-scattering simulations with the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA). Even for particles with the largest dimension of 11.5 wavelengths (and the smallest one comparable to the wavelength), the 2D Fourier transform of the interferometric image remains linked to the 2D autocorrelation of the particle shape at various viewing angles, validating the general measurement principle. However, the sensor must necessarily have wide viewing angle, which complicates interpretation of apparent particle shape, when such particles are observed from the edge. IPI is, thus, shown to be a powerful optical technology for characterizing ice particles down to a few micrometers in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, DDA is a versatile method for such synthetic experiments and can further supply large datasets for development of various inversion methods."}

A bespoke polarization modulation technique is employed to unambiguously separate ultrafast drift currents from the ubiquitous photothermal background.

The interplay between these momenta yields the spin-orbit interaction of light, in which the spin (circular polarization) controls the spatial (orbital) degrees of freedom of light: either the extrinsic (trajectory) or the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (vortex). While the well-known spin-orbit interaction of light plays a crucial role in nano-optics by providing spin-controlled light manipulation, the interaction between the intrinsic and the extrinsic orbital angular momentum - the orbit-orbit interaction of light - has remained elusive. In this interplay, the helical phase fronts of optical vortices control the spatial trajectory of light, giving rise to vortex-dependent shifts of optical beams. We report the orbit-orbit interaction of light in a plasmonic ellipse cavity, whose unique geometry facilitates the interplay when a vortex is considered in one of the foci of the ellipse. In this configuration, the orbit-orbit interaction is achieved by the interplay between the vortex of the source and the ellipse-induced transverse shift of the source beam, positioned at one of the focal points - thus inducing transverse vortex-dependent shifts at the second focal point. Strikingly, the orbit-orbit interaction of light significantly enhances the toolbox available for controlling light by leveraging the manifold orbital angular momentum states for vortex-controlled light manipulation - in contrast to light manipulation based on the spin-orbit interaction, which exploits the binary polarization helicity."}

Here we show that zero-point fluctuations associated with optical phonons naturally suppress long-range electronic coherences and generate clean harmonic spectra without introducing ad-hoc decoherence parameters. Using a 1D semiconductor composed of two distinct sites per unit cell and realistic phonon amplitudes, we demonstrate that random per-site optical-phonon jitter reproduces the spectral sharpening typically attributed to ultrafast $T_2$ dephasing. In contrast, acoustic phonons and local strain, whose distortions are correlated over nanometer scales, produce negligible spectral cleaning. We further show that such long-range site coherence leads to carrier-envelope-phase-dependent effects in the HHG spectrum driven by long pulses, but these effects collapse once optical-phonon-induced decoherence is included. Our results (i) identify optical zero-point motion as a key mechanism governing coherence in solid-state HHG, (ii) demonstrate that it can be qualitatively modeled in periodic solids through site-distance-dependent dephasing, and (iii) suggest that CEP-resolved measurements can probe electronic coherence lengths and atomic fluctuations in crystalline materials."}

Unlike previous approaches, our method is valid for arbitrary dispersion profiles, including resonances, and does not rely on the commonly used frame hopping approach, allowing treatment of multiple-velocity and accelerated systems. Applying this framework to canonical Drude and Lorentz media, we uncover a family of dispersion-mediated space-time states that arise from the multiple frequency transitions permitted by material dispersion.
