However, these stronger measurements\nof motion are naturally accompanied by increased back-action. Here we show how\nresolving the broadband thermal noise spectrum reveals back-action-induced\ncorrelations in the noise from many mechanical modes, even those well-separated\nin frequency. As a result, the observed spectra can deviate significantly from\npredictions of the usual single-mode and (uncorrelated) multimode models over\nthe broad band, notably even at the mechanical resonance peaks. This highlights\nthat these effects must be considered in all systems exhibiting measurement\nback-action, regardless of whether the resonances are spectrally isolated or\nthe readout noise is high enough that the noise peaks appear consistent with\nsimpler models. Additionally, these correlations advantageously allow the\nthermal noise spectrum to reach a minimum -- equivalent to that of a single\nmode -- in a band far from the resonance peak, where the mechanical\nsusceptibility is comparatively stable against frequency noise."}

However, the effect is usually based on dipole resonances\nin the particles. Recently, it has been shown that quadrupole and octupole\nresonances can exhibit comparable, or even higher near-field enhancement. In\nthis work, we focus on the near-field enhancement by a metasurface composed of\ngold-disc dimers arranged in a rectangular array. We find that, owing to an\noctupole plasmon resonance coupled to a surface lattice resonance,\nexceptionally high near-field enhancement in the dimer gaps can be achieved in\nthe visible spectral range. To gain insight into the effect, we develop an\nanalytical model for the effective dipole and octupole polarizabilities of the\nparticles in an array, and discover, that at decreasing array periods, the\ndipole polarizability tends to vanish, while the octupole polarizability\nrapidly increases. Hence, octupole resonances can find applications in\nhigh-density arrays of plasmonic resonators. We propose a method to numerically\nevaluate multipole polarizabilities of a single particle, applying it to the\ngold dimer that we consider. The influence of the array on the effective\npolarizabilities is then verified by numerical calculations and a good\nagreement is obtained.

Here we investigate the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) response in an L-shaped\nnanoantenna structure under the phenomenon of plasmonic analog of enhancement\nin the index of refraction. Using a quantum mechanical approach, we analyze the\nmodulation in the response of probe field and emergence of ENZ frequency region\nboth in the linear and nonlinear plasmonic system. We also demonstrate the\nactive tuning of ENZ frequency region in a nanoantenna structure by modulating\nthe phase of control pulse. The analytical and 3D FDTD simulation results show\na significant spectral shift in the ENZ modes. Our proposed method offers the\npossibility to design and control optical tunable ENZ response in plasmonic\nmetasurfaces without the use of ENZ material. Such metasurfaces can be used in\non-chip photonic integrated circuits, further localization of incident fields,\nslow light operations and various quantum technologies."}

In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's\ndecay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and\nQD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside\na graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid\nmodes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the\ndecay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole\nemission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks\nshows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the\noff-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at\ntuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of\n3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile\nplatform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for\ndeveloping reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable\nsingle-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches."}
