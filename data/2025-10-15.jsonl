However, the fundamental\nscale mismatch between optical wavelengths and molecules restricts the\napplication of label-free techniques, leading to poor signal-to-noise (SNR)\nperformance. Here, we propose a high-contrast, label-free approach based on\ninterferometric imaging, utilizing the strong evanescent field supported on a\nmicrofiber surface to provide near-field illumination. We observed unique\ninterference patterns generated by in-plane scattering from natural defects,\nwhich enabled high-contrast detection of localized phase changes induced by\nsingle molecules. The results indicate an approximately 38 dB enhancement in\nSNR over the conventional fluorescence methods, without employing any plasmonic\nor microcavity-based amplification techniques. This approach was further\napplied to track molecular dynamics, capturing both conformational transition\nand binding behaviors of individual protein molecules. Meanwhile, the\nstimulus-response of single molecules to acoustic waves was investigated,\ndemonstrating the ultimate miniaturization of an acoustic sensor at the\nsingle-molecule scale. By enabling direct observation of molecular dynamics and\nmechanical responses at the single-molecule level, this approach provides a\nversatile platform for probing fundamental biological processes and developing\nultra-sensitive biosensors.

By incorporating the genuine lensed fiber's shape\ninto simulation, we accurately capture the non-Gaussian emission profile of the\nlensed fiber, nullifying the widely accepted approximation using a paraxial\nGaussian mode. We further characterize many lensed fibers and Si3N4 tapers of\nvarying shapes using different fabrication processes. Our experimental and\nsimulation results show remarkable agreement, both achieving maximum coupling\nefficiencies exceeding 80% per facet.
