The highly concentrated energy close to the in the region of the self-focus can lead to other nonlinear phenomena and cause significant irreversible damage to the material. We propose a transverse grid beam structure that effectively suppresses self-focusing even in the absence of other competing effects through the redistribution of optical power by inter-beamlet nonlinear interaction. We find that a beam with a $N \\times N$ grid structure with optimized lattice spacing undergoes a dimension-dependent multi-stage self-focusing. We also identify specific grid layouts that can increase the total transmitted power beyond that permitted by the critical level of self-focusing for each beamlet. Lastly, we derive a general numerical relation between the optimal grid lattice spacing and the size of beamlets. Our results could potentially inform the use of beam shaping to prevent damage to optical components in high-powered and directed-energy applications."}

This tutorial and survey reviews recent advances in HAPS optical communication and integration with atmospheric remote sensing via shared optical links. Among several sensing techniques, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is identified as most promising due to its range-resolved sensitivity, spectral selectivity, and compatibility with HAPS constraints. A roadmap is outlined for implementing telecom-band DIAL on HAPS alongside high-throughput FSO systems. The paper analyzes architectural and atmospheric advantages of HAPS over terrestrial and satellite nodes, emphasizing spatial-temporal coverage, station-keeping ability, and support for compact laser payloads such as DIAL, in-situ sensors, and multispectral imagers. It highlights the feasibility of co-locating sensing and communication within a shared optical and power envelope, especially in the telecom C-band (1.53-1.57 um), enabling trace-gas retrieval (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2S, O3) while maintaining multi-Gbps downlinks. Suitable HAPS architectures (balloons, UAVs, airships) and use cases are identified where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled HAPS outperform satellites and UAVs, including greenhouse gas monitoring, disaster response, air-quality mapping, and 6G NTN extensions. A literature survey for 2005-2025 shows HAPS publications have tripled since 2014, indicating rapid growth.

This study investigates degradation in 21700-type cells with NCM cathodes and graphite/SiOx anodes under cyclic aging, using in operando neutron diffraction, neutron depth profiling, and X-ray computed tomography. Prolonged cycling causes lithium loss, observed on the cathode side as reduced NCM unit cell change during cycling. On the anode side, this loss appears as diminished formation of the fully lithiated LiC6 phase. Differential voltage analysis during aging reveals not only lithium inventory loss but also active anode material loss. Diffraction data confirm this through shifts in the LiC12 transition and LiC6 onset to lower capacities, requiring less lithium to trigger the transitions. Lithium concentration profiles across electrode positions show depletion in the cathode, while elevated concentrations in the anode indicate increased solid-electrolyte interphase formation, suggesting lithium consumed from the cathode deposits on the anode side. CT measurements show that intrinsic inhomogeneities inside the cells have a stronger influence on the macroscopic structure than aging-induced changes, indicating that the observed capacity fade primarily originates from microscopic degradation processes within the electrodes. Overall, the combined techniques provide direct evidence of lithium loss, active material degradation, and spatially dependent aging mechanisms in large-format cylindrical cells."}

However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications."}

These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials."}

Despite its significance, optical devices operating in this band still face two major challenges: chromatic aberration across the wide spectral range and the difficulty of integration due to bulky optical elements. Metalenses are composed of subwavelength nanostructures that locally control the phase and group delay of light, enabling precise wavefront shaping and broadband dispersion compensation. These capabilities make them highly promising for use in infrared optical systems, particularly in applications such as focusing and imaging for compact integrated devices. In this study, we propose a metalens design based on a CaF2 substrate, where each nanocell consists of a single-bar silicon structure. These nanocells are periodically arranged with a 900 nm period, enabling precise control of dispersion and phase. By systematically finetuning the bar length and width, the design enables simultaneous dispersion compensation and phase modulation, achieving stable focusing performance over a broad spectral range. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the metalens design achieves effective suppression of chromatic aberration in the 1800-2300 nm range, maintaining a stable focal position throughout the bandwidth with variation within 6% of the focal length. This design offers a compact, broadband, and high-performance approach for beam collimation and wavefront shaping in the SWIR band, with promising potential for applications in quantum communication and sensing systems."}

This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements. A Gradient Boosting Regressor, using features from a generalized equivalent circuit, showed the best performance. Interpretative analysis indicates open-circuit impedance experiments best probe recombination losses, while short-circuit conditions are more adequate for extracting ionic features like concentrations and mobilities.

In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively.

They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. \"larger is faster\". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS."}

Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background.

Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout.

Effective optical focusing using a RVITM with 33 ms runtime was achieved through porcine liver with decorrelation times as short as 13 ms, demonstrating feasibility for biologically relevant dynamics and supporting the development of adaptive, non-invasive optical control for biomedical applications."}

In integrated photonic devices, non-Hermitian physics can be used for direction-dependent light propagation, reconfigurable light paths, selective energy localization and optical isolators. In this work, we report previously unexplored direction-dependent mode splitting in ring microresonators, achieved by adding multiple scatterers around the cavity. Through experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we unveil the underlying physics that changes the resonance shapes in resonant systems with backscattering. By engineering the spatial configuration of the scatterers, we can produce a predictable and repeatable direction-dependent mode splitting, enabling new ways to route light through optical resonators and photonic networks. In addition, the direction dependent mode-splitting can be used for precise near-field measurements, enhancing traditional sensing in integrated photonic chips."}

However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics."}

Controlling RL emission direction in compact systems remains a challenge. Here we report directional random lasing achieved by infiltrating dye-doped nematic liquid crystals into a nanostructured silica metasurface. By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications."}

We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures."}
