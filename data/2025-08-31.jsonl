While a notable\ncoupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,\ntheir basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization\nof light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating\nstructures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam\nlithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical\ndimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations\nsimultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high\nefficiency in both.
