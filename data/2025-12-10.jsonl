It integrates AI/data science methods into its operation, from data acquisition to automated data labeling and curation workflows. The curation and dissemination of diverse multi-modal data sets will enable the development of new radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection, localization, and tracking algorithms, and methods relevant across the nonproliferation mission space. This paper first introduces the PANDAWN sensor network and the features that make it stand out from previous multi-modal data acquisition efforts. We then review the various data streams acquired on the PANDAWN nodes, and present the implementation of an automated data curation pipeline that includes the labeling of radiation and contextual data streams. We finally provide a short overview of different studies that leveraged the curated data sets."}

In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment."}

However, the output power of a single magnetron is limited by its resonant cavities, posing a physical constraint. High-efficiency coherent power combining based on the injection-locking technique effectively overcomes this limitation and meets the demand for higher output power. Nevertheless, using isolators, such as circulators, introduces significant insertion loss, and the injection signal sources and phase shifters increase the system size, cost, and complexity in a conventional magnetron power combining (MPC) system. A novel method is proposed to utilize the coupling between two ports of an H-plane tee to achieve peer-to-peer injection locking magnetrons. Meanwhile, an asymmetric phase compensation is realized using a section of waveguide to adjust the magnetron output characteristics. Theoretical and numerical analyses provided qualitative insight into the system output behavior. Subsequently, an experimental system was developed for verification. In the experiments, the system achieved maximum microwave power combining efficiencies 90.2%, 93.6%, and 93.6% at electrical waveguide lengths corresponding to 90, 135, and 225, with output powers of 1650, 1260, and 1610 W, respectively, without the use of any isolators or external injection sources. The experimental results show good agreement with numerical calculations. This method offers the advantages of low cost, compact size, and low loss, providing a new approach for developing high-performance MPC systems in the future."}

For fixed bright component particle numbers and a given soliton velocity, the nondegenerate dark-bright-bright solitons exhibit four distinct branches with different density profiles and phase distributions, comprising two positive mass branches and two negative mass branches. The energy-velocity dispersion relation of each pair of positive- and one negative-mass branches form a closed loop, resulting in two mutually independent loops for the soliton's overall dispersion. All soliton branches share a common maximal velocity, which is determined by the larger bright soliton particle number. Linear stability analysis shows that all these branches are stable against weak perturbations. Extending to an $N$-component Manakov system, the nondegenerate solitons have $2^{N-1}$ distinct branches, of which $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is positive mass and $2^{N-2}$ branches solitons is negative mass.

We study the properties of the K$α$ fluorescence for two different short pulse durations and three X-ray incident energies below and above the K-shell absorption edge, and correlate these with incident fluence estimates based on coherent diffraction. We observe that the incident fluence of the pulse and not its duration, is the main factor that modulates the non-linear response, which leads to an effective shortening of the fluorescence emission.

The output characteristics of the injection-pulled magnetron were validated through numerical calculations and experiments. Microwave heating experiments were conducted under both a five-cup water load and an absorbent paper load.

Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons. Our results unveil a new regime of localization in photonic systems, bridging disclination topology, Floquet engineering, and nonlinearity."}

A Case Study in North Spain", "comment": "19 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Potable water utilities are currently making great efforts to reduce leakage rates and assure long-term supply to the population due to the challenges of climate change, growing population and water shortage scenarios that have been on them over the last years. One of the most employed methods to reduce leakage includes the installation of pressurereducing valves along the water distribution network and the utilization of pressure management schemes. Pressure management includes different types of control models, which are applied according to the requirements of each site. The most advanced and sophisticated scheme is critical point control, which relies on a flow signal from a measuring device or online communication between the critical point and the valve. This paper proposes the utilization of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, or the SARIMA model, to correlate pressure at the outlet of the valve and pressure on the critical point of the area supplied, aiming to set a fixed pressure in the critical point. The SARIMA model is developed according to historical data logged in the field and then validated. Later, the SARIMA model was tested on a real location in the village of Noja, Spain. The analysis of the field test results prove that the proposed model is feasible to be used since there is no significance difference between the target values set in the critical point and the real values measured in the field. The research proves that the SARIMA model can be used as an alternative for critical point control in water distribution networks when no flow signal is available or when communication between the critical point and the pressure reducing valve is not an option."}

Due to the self-imaging phenomenon, the SMS structure - formed by splicing a no-core fiber between two singlemode fibers -, provides a broad spectral peak whose central wavelength position is sensitive to variations in the refractive index of the medium surrounding the fiber. In turn, thanks to the in-series SMS-FPI configuration, the sensor's reflection spectrum exhibits the SMS spectral signature modulated by FPI fringes. This readily allows for reducing the width of the spectral features monitored during the sensing measurements, thus enhancing the capabilities of adequately resolving the corresponding spectral shifts. The FPIs reported in this investigation have been fabricated by using two different methods, namely by forming an air-gap FPI between the cleaved ends of two singlemode optical fibers, and by casting a polymeric film onto a connectorized fiber end tip. In the first configuration, the distance between the two cleaved fiber ends could be varied to tune the FPI's free spectral range, hence allowing for tailoring the widths of the spectral oscillations to be monitored during the sensing measurements. Alternatively, the second configuration, while avoiding the use of motorized translation stages, provides a more versatile option for applications. Thus, we understand that our work expands the application of multimode interference and FPIs in sensing scenarios, providing new opportunities for probing physical and chemical parameters by exploring their combined response."}

To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown."}

By correlating two sequences of heterodyne spectra produced by mixing a test laser with a pair of optical combs, DCCS enables rapid (e.g., 1 us) and high-resolution (0.08 pm) spectral retrieval over broad optical bandwidths. Leveraging these capabilities, we reveal mode-hopping and mode-competition dynamics in continuous-wave lasers, as well as the buildup process of a mode-locked laser.

This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication."}

Van der Waals (vdW) crystal MoOCl2 has emerged as a promising candidate for this quest, hosting hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the fundamental anisotropic dielectric tensor governing this behavior has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response (ε_1 < 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response (ε_1 > 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \\approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of δn \\approx 2.2 for MoOCl2. As a result, our work provides the critical missing experimental parameters for MoOCl2, establishing it as a benchmark hyperbolic and ENZ material."}

This approach presents significant challenges due to the detection complexity, as cryogenic conditions hinder the development of scalable systems. In addition, going towards fully-integrated devices or, at least, removing the optical fibers would be also advantageous to develop compact and cost-efficient solutions featuring a high number of optical modes. This work reports on the direct coupling of a PIC, fabricated by femtosecond laser writing (FLW), and a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array, fabricated in a custom planar technology and compatible with the operation at room temperature. The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed."}

Heterogeneous integration of silicon photonics and thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) combines the advantages of both platforms, and enables co-integration of high-performance modulators, photodetectors, and passive photonic components, offering an ideal route to meet these requirements. However, process incompatibilities have constrained the direct integration of TFLN with only passive silicon photonics. Here, we demonstrate the first heterogeneous back-end-of-line integration of TFLN with a full-functional and active silicon photonics platform via trench-based die-to-wafer bonding. This technology introduces TFLN after completing the full CMOS compatible processes for silicon photonics. Si/SiN passive components including low-loss fiber interfaces, 56-GHz Ge photodetectors, 100-GHz TFLN modulators, and multilayer metallization are integrated on a single silicon chip with efficient inter-layer and inter-material optical coupling. The integrated on-chip optical links exhibit greater than 60 GHz electrical-to-electrical bandwidth and support 128-GBaud OOK and 100-GBaud PAM4 transmission below forward error-correction thresholds, establishing a scalable platform for energy-efficient, high-capacity photonic systems."}

We reconstruct the time profile of the emission, and show that the process is entirely governed by the collective response of the tip plasmon and its field emission. Weak-field optical excitation leads to multiphoton absorption and field emission from the tip apex due to the enhanced local field. The attendant sharp field gradient ensures ponderomotive acceleration of emitted electrons and non-local light-matter interaction. The crossover regime in which simultaneous multiphoton absorption and optical field emission take place is evidenced by the time profile of electron emission correlation, laser power dependence, and polarization angle dependence of each harmonic current."}

Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods for trap stiffness calibration are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping has been largely overlooked and is often assumed to behave analogously to translational dynamics. However, rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work covers passive analysis techniques for calibrating the angular trap stiffness and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, while offering unprecedented improvements for nanoparticle analysis. We also explore the combined effects of shape-induced and material birefringence in spheroidal vaterite probes, and present a framework for assessing hydrodynamic and inertial contributions. These results provide a foundation for characterising rotational optical tweezers independent from translational models."}

Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons. Our results unveil a new regime of localization in photonic systems, bridging disclination topology, Floquet engineering, and nonlinearity."}

Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge."}

Using coupled mode theory, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and further validate it via numerical simulations on practical stacked structures. In the EP-QBIC regime, the mode quality (Q) factor can be enhanced by over one order of magnitude. Moreover, we systematically investigate the formation conditions for EP-QBIC states and conventional QBICs. Additionally, introducing an excitation-phase degree of freedom in a pure plasmonic structure allows the Q factor to increase by over 15 times due to QBIC formation-even breaking through the limit imposed by material loss."}

To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\\approx 5 \\%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides."}

These high aspect ratio devices are usually fabricated by complex, costly, multi-step processes that limit their size and volume scaling. These steps commonly involve UV or X-ray lithography, semiconductor selective etching and high-Z metal plating, usually Au, which require expensive tools and materials. Here we present a proof-of-concept fabrication via soft lithography and Hg infusion of microfluidic X-ray absorption gratings and their performance in biomedical imaging. Such fabrication technique requires fewer, less expensive, and more scalable processes using alternative and more sustainable materials, while showing comparable visibility with their conventional Au-based, solid equivalent.

However, signals in pump-probe microscopy are typically small and often must be measured in the presence of large backgrounds. As a result, achieving measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio is challenging, particularly when using sensors that are easily saturated, such as CMOS cameras. We present a method for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding detector saturation. In this approach, temporally separated (sheared) reference and probe pulses transmit through a sample before and after the arrival of a pump pulse. The probe and reference pulses are then temporally recombined with opposing phases and nearly matched amplitudes, resulting in interferometric background subtraction. This recombining operation is performed by a novel common-path interferometer. Unlike previous techniques for temporal shearing, this interferometer demonstrates negligible phase and group delay dispersion with angle of incidence, allowing convenient widefield imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first common-path interferometer with such a property. We demonstrate the technique by measuring transient absorption signals in gold nanorod films with a signal-to-background ratio enhanced by over 100% and a signal-to-noise ratio enhanced by about 70%."}

In this work, we investigate the spatio-temporal equilibrium properties of incoherent multimode optical waves through the analysis of the (2+1)D Bose-Einstein thermal distribution and the corresponding classical Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. In the anomalous dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by positive temperatures. In this regime, we show that as the number of modes of the waveguide increases, the fundamental spatial mode becomes macroscopically populated, while its temporal spectrum undergoes significant narrowing, ultimately leading to complete (2+1)D spatio-temporal condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In the normal dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by negative temperature states that exhibit a hybrid character: the spatial equilibrium displays an inverted modal population, whereas the temporal spectrum remains peaked around the fundamental (carrier) optical frequency. In this regime, we predict that spatio-temporal light waves exhibit a phase transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at negative temperatures, which occurs by increasing the temperature above a negative critical value. Our work opens new avenues for future research, including the possibility for a dual spatio-temporal beam cleaning through full spatio-temporal light condensation, and lay the groundwork for the development of spatio-temporal optical thermodynamics."}
