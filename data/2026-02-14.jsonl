By leveraging the coupling between guided-mode resonance and Fabry-Perot modes, mediated by the phase-transition dynamics of the embedded PCM, the resonance Q factor can be actively tuned. This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor. Consequently, the metasurface exhibits perfect absorption in the amorphous state and a reflection-dominated response in the crystalline state. The proposed metasurface holds significant potential for diverse nanophotonic applications, including photodetection and thermal emission control."}

However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective."}

While significant progress has been made with silicon (Si) and silicon nitride ($Si_3N_4$) platforms, they are often constrained by two-photon absorption (TPA) or moderate nonlinear coefficients, necessitating a trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. Tantalum pentoxide ($Ta_2O_5$), possessing both high nonlinearity and a wide bandgap, emerges as a promising candidate; however, current implementations remain challenged by high pump energy consumption. Here, we report a low-loss $Ta_2O_5$ integrated waveguide fabricated via the Damascene process. It enables the generation of a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a low pulse energy of only 92.9 pJ (60 fs, 1550 nm). Notably, the corresponding peak power is a mere 1.36 kW, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art comparable broadband sources. Furthermore, at the maximum pump energy, our spectrum exhibits an ultrabroad coverage from 450 nm to 3400 nm, spanning nearly three octaves. Supported by numerical simulations, we analyze the dynamics of soliton fission. Furthermore, a Michelson interferometry system developed using this source exhibits superior performance, achieving not only micrometer-scale axial resolution but also a 6 dB sensitivity roll-off length of 3.1 mm. This exceptional roll-off performance, combined with a displacement measurement sensitivity of 346 nm, underscores the immense potential of the $Ta_2O_5$ platform for applications in biomedical imaging and precision metrology."}

Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms."}

In a symmetric configuration, we observe the emergence of diverse phase-matching pathways defined by the dispersive band structure. We develop an analytical model that captures the parametric gain of these interband processes and derive closed-form expressions for the dominant gain maxima; the analytical framework itself readily extends to more complex coupled networks. We further report an asymmetric design that co-engineers mode overlap and dispersion to operate on a compact 7-GHz spacing, free from mode competition. Our findings establish design principles for engineering nonlinear dynamics in coupled-resonator platforms, with implications for coherent photonic computing and quantum information processing."}

The generated near-infrared (NIR) photon pairs exhibit a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR > 20 dB) and are tunable across the 800-1600 nm range.

First, compact transmittance expressions for different configurations are obtained using a generalized Fresnel coefficient method. These expressions are subsequently used to analyze various tunnelling outcomes. We show that two types of tunneling effects can be distinguished, depending on the kind of waves that are present in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate in this layer, the transmittance formula and the phase condition for resonant tunneling are identical to that obtained in a Fabry-Perot etalon. However, in the case of evanescent or damped waves in the core layer, the new expression for transmittance provides another resonant condition related, this time, to the wave amplitude. For clarity, transparent materials are addressed first (including ideal metals), and the implications of absorption are studied later. Different angular-spectral maps are displayed to exemplify the main features of the tunneling effect in each analyzed configuration. To highlight, it is shown that tunnelling can occur in photonic systems with thicknesses up to several wavelengths."}

Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes."}

Heterogeneous DC can substitute material doping and multimaterial structures, and outright enable structure designs not possible otherwise.

Application examples include grayscale lithography, control over writing direction and trajectories, as well as bio-mimicking microphantoms with carefully engineered 3D RI. Results of the RI calibration demonstrate excellent repeatability, accuracy and stability of variable-DC structures. Supported by in-depth metrological analysis, the goal is to popularize variable DC printing within TPP community and to get more out of the existing TPP systems and workflows.

Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems."}

An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\\mathrm{Ca}_x\\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline."}
