Curved-crease origami is designed\nwith even-vertex polygonal trajectories and an elastica curvature profile. We\nthen connect the matching ends to impart multistability. Through this design\napproach, we create various blocks and investigate their snapping and\nload-bearing behavior using finite element analysis. We design block assemblies\nof multi-story and quasi-continuous wall surfaces and fabricate a series of\ndesktop and large-scale prototypes to demonstrate the flexibility and\nadaptability of our system for architectural use.

This\ntutorial presents a systematic approach to modelling and designing phononic\nintegrated circuits on this platform, beginning with acoustic confinement, wave\npropagation and dispersion, mechanical and actuation nonlinearities, as well as\nresonator dynamics. By adapting coupled mode theory from optoelectronics to\nsuspended membranes, and validating this theory with several numerical\ntechniques (finite element modelling, finite difference time domain\nsimulations, and the transfer matrix method), we then provide a comprehensive\nframework to engineer a broad variety of phononic circuit building blocks. As\nillustrative examples, we describe the implementation of several acoustic\ncircuit elements including resonant and non-resonant variable-ratio power\nsplitters, mode converters, mode (de)multiplexers, and in-line Fabry-Perot\ncavities based on evanescent tunnel barriers. These building blocks lay the\nfoundation for phononic integrated circuits with applications in sensing,\nacoustic signal processing, and power-efficient and radiation-hard computing."}

These difficulties arise from the broad operating\nbandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal\nresolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve\nmicrostructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for\nthe first time.

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer\ndevice-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for\nphotonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip\narea cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI\nworkloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by\ntolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems.

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach to engineer large coupling between localized surface\nplasmons (LSPs) in CdO and localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhP) in\nsapphire.
