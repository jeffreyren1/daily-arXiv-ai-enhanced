While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization."}

However, existing electro-optical approaches rely on volatile mechanisms that require continuous power consumption. Here, we demonstrate strong, nonvolatile modulation of optical dispersion in monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML WS2) using patterned ferroelectric domains in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). By locally poling ferroelectric domains into opposite states, we achieve substantial manipulation of the complex refractive index (Delta n > 0.7, Delta k > 0.4) and excitonic energy shifts (~50 meV) in ML WS2, comparable to previous gate-tuning approaches while eliminating continuous power consumption. We introduce an asymmetric screening model that reveals how ferroelectric polarization induces carrier-density-dependent Coulomb screening, leading to distinct excitonic behaviors between electron- and hole-doped regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a gate-free lateral p-n homojunction with a rectification ratio of 6e10^3, formed through spatial carrier redistribution. These findings establish ferroelectric/2D heterostructures as a powerful platform for nonvolatile optical dispersion engineering, enabling energy-efficient, reconfigurable photonic and optoelectronic devices."}

When processed in copper-based double metal waveguides the devices show laser action up to a maximum operating temperature of 188K with a maximum current density of 1.4kA/cm$^2$. The low Joule heating due to reduced active region thickness and low electrical bias allows operation at 10% duty cycle up to a temperature of 170K."}

Here we show that, in a departure from an ideal setting, using an incident beam of finite width, and a $π/2$ phase plate having a finite cutoff, the technique can still deliver $>95\\%$ of the quantum limit. We point out that the Zernike method is, in principle, applicable to any incident beam. As an example, we sketch an approximate implementation of the method for an incident speckle beam, and show that it too can deliver $>95\\%$ of the quantum limit."}

To overcome this limitation, we present near-infrared LDHM (NIR-LDHM), a in-line holographic platform that operates up to the silicon cutoff (~1100 nm) using a conventional board-level CMOS sensor designed for visible (VIS) imaging. Using tissue-mimicking milk scattering layers and calibrated resolution targets, we quantify reconstruction performance versus wavelength, scattering strength, and sample-sensor distance. NIR-LDHM maintains resolvable features through scattering layers up to ~1.4 mm, whereas visible regime fails to resolve features below ~350 um. Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively. By extending lensless complex-field microscopy into strongly scattering regimes with minimal hardware changes, this work has relevance to computational imaging through complex media and biophotonics."}

Rodríguez-Fortuño"], "title": "A robust and efficient method to calculate electromagnetic modes on a cylindrical step-index nanofibre", "comment": "7 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "The accurate calculation of guided electromagnetic modes in optical nanofibres is critical for applications in nanophotonics, from quantum interfaces to vectorial light sensing. Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure. This method provides a powerful and reliable tool for the design and analysis of nanofibre-based devices, particularly for applications in chiral quantum optics and nanophotonics where precise knowledge of field polarisation and specifically of the longitudinal components is paramount."}
