Hyperbolic polaritons (HPs) $-$ hybrid light-matter excitations in materials with opposite-signed dielectric permittivity tensor components $-$ offer a solution through their ability to support deep sub-wavelength confinement and unique optical phenomena such as canalization and negative refraction. To date, however, the most widely studied hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) crystals, including hBN and $α$-MoO$_3$, operate mainly in the mid-infrared, leaving the telecommunication bands (1260$-$1675 nm) largely uncovered. Here, we predict HPs operating directly in the telecommunication window in the vdW crystal molybdenum oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Building on recent evidence that MoOCl$_2$ can support plasmon polaritons in the visible, we theoretically investigate its optical response at telecom wavelengths and identify the conditions under which strongly confined, canalized HPs modes emerge. Beyond establishing a telecom platform, we outline device-level opportunities enabled by these modes, including diffraction-free waveguides based on canalization, tunable polaritonic crystals, and high-efficiency spontaneous emission-enhancement platforms. These paradigms cover the essential pillars of on-chip information processing: emission, propagation, modulation and detection. Our results establish MoOCl$_2$ as a potentially transformative material that bridges physics of hyperbolic PPs with potential practical implementations, opening avenues for ultra-compact, high-density, and low-power photonic components."}

Unlike canonical self-accelerating solutions such as Airy beams, general curved-beam propagation enables arbitrary, application-specific trajectories that are not constrained by analytic beam families. Here, we demonstrate a passive and reconfigurable approach for generating trajectory-engineered THz curved beams using inverse-designed bilayer diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Two phase-only diffractive layers are optimized using gradient-based inverse design to produce predetermined curved propagation paths. Reconfiguration is achieved by a 180° rotation of the second layer, which modifies the effective phase profile of the cascaded structure without altering the incident wave or individual layer designs. The proposed system can produce distinct curved trajectories with controlled transverse displacement and beam confinement, as confirmed by scalar diffraction simulations and experimental measurements. Overall, this work establishes inverse-designed cascaded DOEs as a compact and scalable platform for reconfigurable trajectory control of THz beams, providing a flexible alternative to analytic self-accelerating beams for radiative near-field THz communications."}

Here, we introduce a high-energy, low-photodamage CARS (HELP-CARS) platform designed to overcome these physical limitations. By employing a 1-MHz non-collinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) with extensive pulse chirping, HELP-CARS increases the coherent Raman excitation efficiency by ~300 times and improves the signal-to-nonresonant background ratio by 11 times, while inducing negligible damage during live cell imaging. Furthermore, to remove non-independent noise and physically entangled non-resonant background, we incorporate self-supervised deep-learning denoising and background removal based on the Kramers-Kronig relationship, yielding sensitivity improvement by an additional order of magnitude. Together, these advances provide a micromolar imaging sensitivity (160 uM for Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6) corresponding to 1000 molecules in the focal volume. Such high sensitivity enables high-fidelity chemical imaging in both fingerprint and silent windows. Hyperspectral HELP-CARS imaging of deuterated fatty acids allowed first observation of chemical separation with single lipid droplet. Together, HELP-CARS offers a powerful and generalizable approach for ultrasensitive and quantitative vibrational imaging of biological systems."}

Conventional plasmonic approaches typically enhance chirality at the cost of amplifying achiral attraction and heating. Here, we overcome this trade-off by exploiting longitudinal Mie resonances in silicon nanodisks. By employing an Azimuthally-Radially Polarized Beam (ARPB) illumination, we selectively excite longitudinal Mie resonances, with strong optical chirality gradients and comparatively uniform electric field intensities. Specifically, magnetic quadrupole (MQ) resonances, effectively decouple enantioselective forces from the achiral background, providing uniquely favorable conditions for enantioselective optical trapping. Combining full-wave simulations with Kramers' escape-rate theory, we demonstrate a robust trapping system that is both thermally stable and highly selective. We predict trapping selectivity ratios above 100 for particles with Pasteur parameters $|κ| \\geq$ 0.03 and maintain selectivities above 2 even for weakly chiral analytes ($|κ| \\approx$ 0.006). These results establish longitudinal Mie resonances in high-index dielectric nanostructures as a promising, non-invasive platform for all-optical chiral analysis and enantiomer separation."}

Above performance arises from a dual-laser self-injection-locking scheme to a single Fabry-Perot cavity with high Q exceeding 10^8, with over 20 dB common-mode noise suppression. The low-noise nature of such reference is coherently transferred to the X-band through a high-performance TFLN electro-optic comb chip, thereby overcoming long-standing barriers in photonic microwave integration to enable truly field-deployable low-noise microwave generation."}

Although CRIT serves as a building block for slow light in photonic integrated circuits, recent advances in topological photonics motivate a further generalization of both EIT and CRIT using gauge-field degrees of freedom. Here, we propose generalized CRIT via a spinor representation with dual-channel gauge fields, enabling fully programmable CRIT featuring dynamical spectral engineering. We generalize the traditional EIT framework by introducing a spinor representation of bright- and dark-mode resonances, yielding a unified description of design parameters through universal unitary operations. Implementing a coupled-resonator building block that accesses the entire design space through dual-channel gauge fields, we demonstrate a programmable slow-light band in a one-dimensional CRIT lattice. These results address urgent needs in optical interconnects, such as tunable delay lines, reconfigurable synchronization, and linear frequency conversion."}

The cavity maps input data into spatially stable, class-separable intensity distributions, enabling a simple linear classifier to achieve accuracies of 85--99\\% across diverse benchmarks -- including medical imaging and remote sensing -- with orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters than deep neural networks. Our results establish multimode fiber lasers as compact, low-power physical processors for scalable optical machine learning."}

XUV transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) is an emerging tool that combines the advantages of both absorption and reflectivity while offering intrinsically background-free detection. Here, we implement XUV-TGS by generating a transient grating in germanium solid using two few-cycle near-infrared pulses and probing it with an attosecond XUV pulse, produced via tabletop high-harmonic generation. The spectrally resolved, diffracted XUV pulses directly visualize the separate ultrashort decay times of both photoexcited electrons and holes, without the need for iterative deconvolution. By combining XUV-TA and -TG spectroscopy, we extract the evolution of the complex refractive index, ñ, without the need for Kramers-Kronig reconstruction, as required in XUV-TR, allowing us to extract the roots of the induced optical response. We find reflectivity changes of up to 34% via the real part of ñ, whereas changes in the imaginary part only result in a variation in reflectivity of around 0.5%."}

Unlike free-space electromagnetic waves, whose polarization degeneracy enables flexible polarization manipulation, planar integrated optical structures lack such degree of freedom owing to intrinsic structural anisotropy. Here, we propose a planar optical ring resonator based on a subwavelength grating waveguide that supports two quasi-degenerate modes. We demonstrate that coupling of these modes in the ring resonator leads to the formation of the resonances with a predominant direction of electric-field rotation in the vicinity of the resonator, resulting in the non-zero transverse optical spin. The average degree of circular polarization in the proposed structures reaches values of up to 70%. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experimental validation in the microwave spectral range. Our findings suggest a viable route toward realization of on-chip optical spintronic and valleytronic interfaces."}

Using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) and lensless digital holographic microscopy with pixel super-resolution (LDHM-PSR), we demonstrate markedly improved high-throughput visualization of microstructural features after GTS immersion compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The improvement is confirmed quantitatively by a significant increase in the one-pixel-lag autocorrelation of phase-gradient values, indicating reduced scattering-driven phase artifacts and enhanced structural continuity in reconstructed phase maps. We further show that GTS is stable for months at room temperature, provides instant yet durable clearing that improves over time, and can be removed by brief PBS washing, enabling downstream multimodal analyses on the same specimen. Finally, we benchmark GTS against the state-of-the-art clearing agent Ce3D, highlighting GTS as a low-cost, safe, operationally straightforward alternative with strong potential for routine, high-throughput QPI-based histopathology workflows."}

In optics, customized spatiotemporally structured optical fields, especially spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOV), offer the potential to tailor light via coupled space-time degrees of freedom. However, the interaction mechanisms between multiple transverse orbital angular momentum singularities within a single wave packet remain elusive. This study explores the intrinsic dynamics of a STOV with three phase singularities, observing a pronounced vortex singularity oscillation phenomena by tuning the temporal dispersion. We show that these phenomena originate from the counterintuitive spatiotemporal attractive effect between vortices, which is closely related to the singularity distance. Furthermore, the stretching into filaments and annihilation behaviors is observed by introducing antivortex in the center of the wavepacket. Experimentally, we propose a Full Interferometric Retrieval of Spatiotemporal Tomography (FIRST) method that enables the complete, single-shot capture of wave packets, with excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of transverse spatiotemporal singularities within a single wave packet are reported here for the first time. These findings confirm the existence of interesting interactions between STOV singularities, deepen our understanding of photonics and open a new direction for investigating the complex dynamics of vortex singularities in the spatiotemporal domain."}

However, it lacks nonvolatile index tuning mechanisms, which promise to pave the way for energy-efficient photonic computing. Here, we explore electrochemical lithiation as a route to nonvolatile matrix-vector multiplications in TFLN. The LiNbO3 phase is stable at room temperature over a 2% Li composition window with an associated composition-dependent refractive index. We computationally demonstrate this as a programmable, low-loss approach to perform matrix-vector multiplications by using composition to control matrix weights. We design Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform image processing tasks under realistic material loss constraints. We also design microring resonators for iterative weight updates, using gradient descent training to program target matrix operations with matrix-vector multiplication accuracy validated at 1.5% average relative error.
