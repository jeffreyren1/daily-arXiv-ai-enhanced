Here we seek to establish a\nenergy-based interpretation for this coefficient by linking it to the ratio of\nthe dissipated or stored energy in the CPE relative to that supplied by the\ninput source. Using the $RC$ network equivalency of a CPE, we decompose the\ntotal input energy into a contribution stored in the capacitive modes and\nanother dissipated in the resistive modes. Analytical expressions are derived\nfor three test examples: (i) a constant voltage, (ii) a voltage ramp, and (iii)\na quadratic input of the form $v(t)=\\lambda t^2$. In all cases we found that\nthe ratios of any two of these energy quantities reduce to pure functions of\nthe dispersion coefficient of the CPE, independent of excitation amplitude or\nmaterial parameters. This result provides a new perspective of the CPE's\ndispersion coefficient from a thermodynamic/energetic basis, with direct\nimplications for supercapacitor characterization, battery modeling, as well as\nfor the analysis of other electrochemical systems and devices exhibiting the\nCPE behavior."}

The self-absorption of\nthe IR emission could be achieved through the sub-band-gap excitations due to\ndefect-related intermediate levels in forbidden energy band-gap, creating\ncarriers (electrons and holes). Some of the carriers diffuse into the built-in\nelectric field of the junction. The built-in field then sweeps out electrons\nand holes in opposite directions, forming IR-generated photocurrent.

Surface passivation was performed using ammonium\nsulphide chemical treatment followed by encapsulation with a 100 nm silicon\nnitride layer deposited via low-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour\ndeposition. Time-resolved electroluminescence measurements reveal differential\ncarrier lifetimes (${\\tau}$) of ~0.61 ns for nanoarray LEDs with pillar\ndiameters of ~440 nm, a record-long lifetime for electrically driven GaAs-based\nnanopillar arrays. Under low injection conditions, the devices exhibited\ncarrier lifetimes of ~0.41 ns, indicating successful suppression of\nnon-radiative effects and a low surface velocity, ranging from\n$S$~0.7$\\times$10$^4$ cm/s to 2.7$\\times$10$^4$ cm/s. This reveals a potential\nhigh internal quantum efficiency $IQE$~0.45 for our nanoLEDs operating under\nvery high injection conditions, limited only by Auger recombination and\nself-heating effects at high current density. These miniaturized nanoLEDs with\nhigh radiative recombination efficiency and sub-ns modulation response pave the\nway for optical data communications, energy efficient optical interconnects,\nAR/VR displays, and neuromorphic computing applications."}

The spatial intensity distributions,\ndistorted by dynamic turbulence, are represented using Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs), whose probability landscapes are refined via Kernel Density Estimation\n(KDE) applied to pixel-level intensity data across temporal frames. The\ntemporal evolution of turbulence is quantified by monitoring the variation of\nthe unnormalized volumetric integrals under the GMM surfaces, providing a\ncontinuous measure of power redistribution within the optical field.\nExperimental investigations were carried out under four propagation conditions:\nturbulence-free reference, turbulence only, turbulence with a single PMMA\ncompensator, and turbulence with dual PMMA compensators. To assess statistical\ndissimilarity, Affine-Invariant Riemannian Metric (AIRM) distances were\ncomputed between the covariance representations of successive frames, capturing\nthe geometric evolution of beam topology in the space of Symmetric Positive\nDefinite (SPD) matrices. Complementary topological distance analyses, performed\nwith respect to the initial frame of each set, revealed distinct signatures of\nturbulence-induced aberrations and their progressive mitigation through\ndielectric compensation.

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel\nmethod to create GaN-based RCLEDs by using photo-electrochemical etching and\nmicro-transfer printing (MTP) technology. Through systematic optimizing of the\netching conditions, highly selective etching of an InGaN multiple quantum well\nsacrificial layer is achieved with parasitic etching of adjacent layers being\ncompletely suppressed. The roughness of the underside of the exfoliated GaN\nfilm is only 3.3 nm. Raman spectroscopy shows that the residual stress in the\nreleased material is reduced from 0.74 GPa for the as-grown sample to -0.15\nGPa. Using the MTP method, GaN coupons with a deposited upper dielectric mirror\nwere transferred onto target substrates covered with either an Al mirror or\ndielectric distributed Bragg reflector to form two types of blue RCLEDs. The\nelectroluminescence spectra of the two RCLEDs show a much narrower linewidth,\nreduced from 32 nm in the conventional LED to ~5 nm, together with stable peak\nwavelength with increasing current density, with the shift reduced from 9.3 nm\nto less than 1 nm. The far-field pattern is influenced by the bottom mirror,\nand the far-field divergence angle can be decreased to only 52{\\deg} by\nmatching the cavity and the quantum well exciton modes.

The most common mechanisms\nfor their generation rely on cubic nonlinearities, for instance in crystals,\noptical fibers, and integrated photonics.

Despite such potentials, demonstrations of QSCG in integrated\nphotonic waveguides have been sparse and have barely surpassed their cubic\ncounterparts in terms of spectral coverage and energy-efficiency.
