Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks."}

To address this, we recently demonstrated, by modifying Euler-angle parameterization, that an optical gadget consisting of two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, each endowed with the same topological charge $q$, operates as a viable SU(2) gadget for the higher-order Poincaré sphere, contingent upon the fulfillment of the holonomy condition. This work presents the controlled navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere through the proposed architecture, formulated under the concept of an effective waveplate and thus can be referred to as an effective SU(2) gadget. The notion of an effective waveplate refers to a coaxial arrangement of multiple waveplates that, under specific constraints, can act as a single waveplate. In this gadget, the relative alignment of the offset angles of the constituent $q$-plates emerges as the decisive parameter governing systematic navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere. This study bear direct relevance to the deterministic control and engineering of structured light, encompassing polarization singularities, vector vortex beams and topological optical fields. Moreover, these results holds potential applications in the contemporary research frontiers in singular optics, spin-orbit photonics and quantum communication."}

However, they face challenges in sensing gases with high sensitivity due to weak light-gas interaction. Slow light, which dramatically intensifies light-matter interaction through spatial compression of optical energy, provides a promising solution. Herein, we demonstrate a dual slow-light scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) with a suspended photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) on a CMOS-compatible silicon platform. By tailoring the dispersion of the PhCW to generate structural slow light to enhance pump absorption and probe phase modulation, we achieve a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1, over 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the strip waveguides and optical fibers. With a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW incorporated in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a footprint of 0.6 mm2, we demonstrate acetylene detection with a sensitivity of 1.4x10-6 in terms of noise-equivalent absorption and length product (NEAL), the best among the reported photonic waveguide gas sensors to our knowledge. The dual slow-light enhanced PTS paves the way for integrated photonic gas sensors with high sensitivity, miniaturization, and cost-effective mass production."}

Detecting such leaks remains extremely challenging due to the weak acoustic emission and high ambient noise in the deep sea. This paper reviews the application of passive sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) in underwater oil and gas leak detection. The advantages and limitations of traditional monitoring methods, including fibre optic, capacitive and pH sensors, are compared with those of passive sonar systems. Advanced AI methods that enhance signal discrimination, noise suppression and data interpretation capabilities are explored for leak detection. Emerging solutions such as embedded AI analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), deep learning-based denoising networks and semantically aware underwater optical communication (UOC) frameworks are also discussed to overcome issues such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmission instability. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal models (GRU, TCN) is proposed to improve the classification and quantification accuracy of leak events. Despite challenges such as data scarcity and environmental change, AI-assisted passive sonar has shown great potential in real-time, energy-efficient and non-invasive underwater monitoring, contributing to sustainable environmental protection and maritime safety management."}

In the effort to enhance the amount of spatial and angular-momentum information retrievable from a single measurement, and to overcome current phase-grating efficiency limits, here we demonstrate multimode structured neutron beams that enable simultaneous access to multiple, well-defined OAM modes, and to hybrid combinations of OAM and Airy states. This multimode approach, analogous to wavelength- or OAM-multiplexing in optics, facilitates the efficient investigation of material scattering properties and nuclear interactions with a neutron source composed of a discretized OAM spectrum."}

Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration."}

A strategy to realize such sources relies on the cooperative coupling of quantum emitters, enabling collective light emission known as superradiance. Here, we demonstrate that organic molecular J-aggregates exhibit room temperature superradiant emission that transitions to a highly collective regime of ~250 synchronized J-excitons when strongly coupled to delocalized photonic modes of a silicon bound-state-in-the-continuum metasurface. This enhanced cooperativity manifests as a Rabi splitting dependent scaling of both emission rate and intensity, driving the system into a superbunching regime of photon statistics. At the highest excitation density, we observe massively superbunched photon emission with g2(0)>13, unlocking new possibilities for engineering ultrafast, temporally correlated light sources that can operate at room temperature."}

We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic."}

The Hamiltonian evolution ensures energy conservation and the final temperature is fully determined by the initial conditions. In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory."}

The device consists of a crossbar structure with a Ta/CoFeB/Ta/MgO/Ta bottom electrode and a LiPON/Pt top electrode. A chaotic Mackey-Glass time series is encoded into a voltage signal applied to the device, while 2D Fourier transforms of voltage-dependent magnetic domain patterns form the output. Performance is influenced by the input rate, smoothing of the output, the number of elements in the reservoir state vector, and the training duration. We identify two distinct computational regimes: short-term prediction is optimized using smoothed, low-dimensional states with minimal training, whereas prediction around the Mackey-Glass delay time benefits from unsmoothed, high-dimensional states and extended training. Reservoir computing metrics reveal that slower input rates are more tolerant to output smoothing, while faster input rates degrade both memory capacity and nonlinear processing. These findings demonstrate the potential of magneto-ionic systems for neuromorphic computing and offer design principles for tuning performance in response to input signal characteristics."}

Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing \"physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation\" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions."}

In previous works, signatures of topology have mainly been investigated from the perspective of edge states - strongly localised modes with exponentially decaying intensity into the bulk. While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\\langle σ_\\mathrm{x} \\rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond."}
