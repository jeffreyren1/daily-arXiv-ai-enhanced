In this paper, we study the effects of anisoplanatism,\nor the physical separation of the beacon and transmit light, on two-wavelength\nAO systems for imaging and beam projection applications. We derive the\npiston-removed (PR) and piston-and-tilt-removed (PTR) optical-path-difference\n(OPD) variances including anisoplanatism, which are key metrics of AO system\nperformance. We compare our closed-form PR and PTR OPD variances to numerical\nresults and discuss their physical significance. In addition, we introduce the\ntwo-wavelength isoplanatic angle and show how it can be used to quickly assess\ntwo-wavelength AO system performance. At large, the analysis contained in this\npaper will inform the design and implementation of two-wavelength AO systems\nfor multiple imaging and beam projection applications."}

We present an elegant\nsolution: a versatile and reconfigurable dual-polarization Si3N4 microresonator\nthat represents a paradigm shift in on-chip photonic designs. Our device, based\non a binary-star orbital architecture, can be dynamically reconfigured into\nthree distinct topologies: a M\\\"obius-like microcavity, a Fabry-P\\'erot\nresonator, and a microring resonator. This unprecedented functionality is\nenabled by a tunable balanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer that facilitates\ncontrollable mutual mode coupling of counterpropagating lights using a single\ncontrol knob. We experimentally demonstrate that the device not only supports\npolarization-diverse operation on a compact footprint but also gives rise to a\nrich variety of physical phenomena, including a standing wave cavity, a\ntraveling wave cavity, free spectral range multiplication, and the photonic\npinning effect. These behaviors are accurately modeled using the Transfer\nMatrix Method and intuitively explained by Temporal Coupled Mode Theory. Our\nresults underscore the profound potential for a chip-scale platform to realize\nreconfigurable reconstructive spectrometers and on-chip synthetic dimensions\nfor topological physics."}

Operating at\n10-kHz repetition rate with up to 104 W of pump power on a 10-wafer stack, we\nmeasure 26.4 mW of THz average power for a narrowband multi-cycle source. We\nidentify and quantify strong lensing effects causing dramatic beam focusing in\n47 wafer stacks which act as a primary limitation in the current configuration,\nand present mitigation strategies for future scaling.

In this regard, lasing nano-pixels emitting\nlight in the spectral range 400-700 nm are highly demanded. Despite progress in\nred, green, and ultraviolet nanolasers, the demonstrated blue-range (400-500\nnm) single-particle-based lasers are still not subwavelength yet. Here we\nfabricate CsPbCl$_3$ cubic-shaped single-crystal nanolasers on a silver\nsubstrate by wet chemistry synthesis, producing their size range around 100-500\nnm, where the nanoparticle with sizes\n0.145$\\mu$m$\\times$0.195$\\mu$m$\\times$0.19$\\mu$m and volume 0.005 $\\mu$m$^3$\n(i.e. $\\sim\\lambda^3$/13) is the smallest nanolaser among the lasers operating\nin the blue range reported so far, with emission wavelength around\n$\\lambda\\approx 415$ nm. Experimental results at a temperature of 80 K and\ntheoretical modeling show that the CsPbCl$_3$ nanolaser is a polaritonic laser\nwhere exciton-polaritons are strongly coupled with Mie resonances enhanced by\nthe metallic substrate. As a result, the combination of the strong excitonic\nresponse of CsPbCl$_3$ materials, its high crystalline quality, and optimized\noptical resonant properties resulting in a population-inversion-free lasing\nregime are the key factors making the proposed nanolaser design superior among\npreviously reported ones in the blue spectral range."}

Discretized Floquet evolution provides a controlled\nroute, where the time-ordered sequencing of non-commuting Hamiltonians imprints\ncomplex hopping phases and breaks time-reversal symmetry. However, stabilizing\nsuch driven dynamics and observing unambiguous topological signatures on a\nreconfigurable platform has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate synthetic\ngauge fields for light on a programmable photonic processor by implementing\ndiscretized Floquet drives that combine static and dynamic phases. This\napproach reveals hallmark features of topological transport: chiral circulation\nthat reverses under drive inversion, flux-controlled interference with high\nvisibility, and robust directional flow stabilized by maximizing the minimal\nFloquet quasi-energy gap. The dynamics are further characterized by a\nfirst-harmonic phase order parameter, whose per-period winding number\nquantifies angular drift and reverses sign with the drive order. These results\nestablish discretized, gap-optimized Floquet evolution as a versatile and fully\nprogrammable framework for topological photonics, providing a compact route to\nengineer gauge fields, stabilize driven phases, and probe winding-number\nsignatures of chiral transport."}
