We use non-integer-order\nintegro-differential operators that can be interpreted as generalizations of\nscaling (dilation) differential operator for the case of non-locality.\nNonlinear integro-differential equations with Hadamard type operators of\nnon-integer orders with respect to time and periodic sequence of kicks are\nconsidered. Exact solutions of these equations are derived without using\napproximations. Using these solutions for discrete time points, we derive\nmappings with non-local scaling in time from proposed equations without\napproximation. Non-local mappings are obtained in general for arbitrary orders\nof the Hadamard type fractional operators. An example of these mappings with\nnon-local scaling in time is given for arbitrary positive orders of\nintegro-differential equations with kicks. The proposed mappings are\nindependent of the period of kicks at zero initial conditions. The proposed\napproach can be used to describe the nonlinear fractional dynamics that is\ncharacterized by scale invariance."}

Synthetic mammalian pattern formation has been recently achieved\nthrough a reaction-diffusion system based on the short-range activator (Nodal)\nand the long-range inhibitor (Lefty) topology, where a single function\nregulates both morphogens. In this paper, we investigate the emergence of\nTuring patterns in the synthetic Nodal-Lefty system. First, we prove the\nexistence of a global solution and derive conditions for Turing instability\nthrough linear stability analysis. Subsequently, we examine the behavior of the\nsystem near the bifurcation threshold, employing weakly nonlinear analysis, and\nusing multiple time scales, we derive the amplitude equations for supercritical\nand subcritical cases.

Its principal limitation, however, is\nthat it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the\nabsolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work,\nwe introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for\nquantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements.\nThe method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic\ndifferentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer.\nThe method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to\nadapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely\ndetermined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most\nsystems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint\noptimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly\nversatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear\nvectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears,\nthe inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and\nsign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or\neven single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of\nshear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen\npixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and\nexperimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects\nand demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid\ncells."}

Specifically, by integrating graphene sheets into the unit\ncell of metallodielectric superlattices, the presence or absence of topological\ninterface modes can be dynamically controlled by tuning the permittivity of\ngraphene via electrical gating. These topological modes emerge when the spatial\naverage of the permittivity of the superlattices is negative and vanish as the\nchemical potential of graphene is adjusted to render the averaged permittivity\npositive. The dependence of the existence of topological interface modes on the\nsign of the spatial average of the permittivity is fundamentally related to the\nemergence of a Dirac point, which arises when the averaged permittivity of the\nsuperlattices reaches zero and is accompanied by the Zak phase transition, thus\nresulting in the appearance and disappearance of topological interface modes.\nFurthermore, we find that the propagation constant of topological interface\nmodes decreases when increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The\nrobustness of such topological interface modes is also demonstrated. Our work\nprovides clear physical insights and offers a promising approach to the dynamic\ncontrol of topological interface modes."}

However,\nexisting designs often face challenges related to durability, fabrication\ncomplexity, and response consistency. To address these issues, we propose a\nmodular architecture that decomposes whisker sensors into five functional\ncomponents: the whisker element (WE), compliant element (CE), sensing element\n(SE), support structure (SS), and data acquisition module (DAQ). We develop and\ncompare four in-house sensor designs built using this architecture, each\ndiffering in material choice, sensing modality, and mechanical structure. To\nunify heterogeneous sensor outputs, we introduce a calibration strategy that\nmaps raw sensor readings-whether from pressure, magnetic flux, or visual\nfeatures-into a common representation: the bending moment at the whisker base.\nThis representation supports consistent interpretation and comparison across\nsensing techniques. We adopt texture roughness analysis as a representative\nsensing task to evaluate design trade-offs. Each whisker sensor's\nfrequency-domain response is benchmarked against a high-resolution laser sensor\nusing standardized roughness specimens. Empirical results show that rigid\nwhiskers improve accuracy in texture classification, while flexible whiskers\nprovide robustness for exploratory robotics tasks.
