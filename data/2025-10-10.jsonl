[PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a\nnon-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled\nvia quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at\na discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the\ngraph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden.\nIn the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by\nthe magnetic Schr\\\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation.\nUsing a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the\npresence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\\delta$-type vertex boundary\nconditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions\ncontinuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission\ncoefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular\nfiltering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable\nsteering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping\napplications."}

The Fabry-P\\'{e}rot resonator is a popular\nchoice for its high optical access and large emitter-mirror separation. A\ntypical configuration, particularly for emitters that should not be placed\nclose to the mirror surface like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms, features two\nspherical mirrors placed around a central emitter, but this arrangement can put\ndemanding requirements on the mirror alignment. In contrast, plano-concave\ncavities are tolerant to mirror misalignment and only require the manufacture\nof one curved mirror, but have limited ability to focus light in the centre of\nthe cavity. Here we show how mirror shaping can overcome this limitation of\nplano-concave cavities while preserving the key advantages. We demonstrate\nthrough numerical simulations that simple mirror shaping can increase coupling\nbetween a plano-concave cavity and a central emitter by an order of magnitude,\neven rivalling misalignment-sensitive concave-concave counterparts for\nachievable interaction strength. We use these observations to establish the\nconditions under which plano-concave cavities with shaped mirrors could improve\nthe performance and practicality of emitter-cavity systems."}

Spectral band structures are\nconstructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse\ndielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the\nmain collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our\nearlier model based on multipole-Pad\\'e approximants (MPA) to incorporate both\nmomentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic\nquasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic\nenergy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and\noverlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also\nfind good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the\noptical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point\nthat can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in\nplasmonics and spectroscopy."}

[PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a\nnon-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled\nvia quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at\na discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the\ngraph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden.\nIn the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by\nthe magnetic Schr\\\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation.\nUsing a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the\npresence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\\delta$-type vertex boundary\nconditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions\ncontinuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission\ncoefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular\nfiltering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable\nsteering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping\napplications."}

Solutions of three different forms are addressed which include\nbright, gray-dark, and gray-gray solitons. In the limit of long-wavelength\ntransverse perturbations, the instability is described with an asymptotic\nexpansion whose predictions agree with the results of numerical simulations.\nThe dynamic development of instability of initially perturbed bright solitons\nleads to the formation of high-intensity spots in the photonic component. For\ngray-dark and dark-dark solitons, the transverse instability leads to the\nspontaneous nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs which emerge in both fields\nas transient patterns."}
