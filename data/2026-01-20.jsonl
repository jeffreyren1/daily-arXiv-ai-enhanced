Herein, we propose a novel experimental scenario for investigating radiation RR within the classical radiation-dominated regime (CRDR), via the collision of a high-intensity petawatt-class laser with a tens-of-MeV electron beam from a LINAC. This approach enables access to a distinct parameter regime wherein RR dominates electron dynamics while quantum effects remain modest. Numerical simulations demonstrate that three key observables exist for identifying the RR within this CRDR regime: (i) quantitative measurement of energy spectra to validate the quantum correction factor; (ii) control of the collision time delay with charge-counting to map intensity dependence of RR; and (iii) verification of large angle ($90^\\circ$) photon emission under the recoil condition $2γ\\gtrsim a_0$. These experimental measurements will establish the benchmarks for RR models spanning the classical-to-quantum regime, thereby providing critical insights into fundamental strong-field quantum electrodynamics."}

By solving Maxwell's equations in covariant form, we show that torsion induces intrinsic chirality and circular birefringence: right- and left-circular polarizations acquire different wavenumbers, leading to a purely geometric optical activity. The polarization plane of a linearly polarized beam rotates according to the simple law $Δθ= ΩρL$, linear in the dislocation density $Ω$, propagation length $L$, and transverse coordinate $ρ$. This can be recast as an effective birefringence $Δn = 2cΩρ/ω$, providing geometric design rules for torsion-induced rotatory power. Using parameters from dislocated semiconductors, we obtain millidegree rotations over millimetre-scale paths, within reach of modern polarimetric techniques and amenable to enhancement in metamaterial platforms. We also show that the same spiral geometry implements a broadband geometric phase gate for polarization qubits and has an electronic analogue on the surface of cylindrical topological insulators, where torsion shears the Dirac cone, establishing a unified geometric link between torsion, optical activity, and topological electronic responses."}

Indeed, this progress has entailed investigations into various HCPCF designs, allowing for attaining diverse properties of interest such as ultralow loss, polarization filtering, and specific modal operation. Among HCPCFs with tailored modal characteristics are fibers displaying microstructures with modified symmetry, which allow for changing the loss hierarchy between the guided modes, hence favoring the propagation of higher-order modes. In this context, we here demonstrate the realization of an angle sensor utilizing a tubular HCPCF with a two-fold symmetric cladding. This specific fiber design enables the generation of an output intensity profile resulting from the superposition of LP01 and LP11-like modes, whose excitation and resulting output intensity spatial distribution are dependent on the polarization angle of the incident light. Thus, by rotating the input beam's polarization and analyzing the evolution of the resulting output profile, we characterized a rotation angle sensor exhibiting a sensitivity of 25 counts/degree and an estimated resolution of 0.3°. We understand that this work broadens the framework of HCPCF applications, demonstrating that symmetry-modified hollow-core fibers can act as a promising platform for advanced sensing scenarios and polarimetric characterizations."}

The coupling between PPs and NEs through the radiated optical field leads to establishment of a significant cross-correlation between NEs, so that their internal dynamics (photocurrent affected by the laser irradiation) depends on the NR's plasma frequency $ω_{p}$. The transition to this regime,combined with the nonlinearity of the system, leads to a steep increase of the photocurrent in the NEs, as well as to non-smooth (chimera-like or chaotic) behavior in the critical (transition) region, where small variations of $ω_{p}$ lead to significant changes in the level of the NE pairwise cross-correlations. The chimera-like state is realized as coexistence of locally synchronized and desynchronized NE dynamical states. A fit of the dependence of the critical current on $ω_{p}$ is found, being in agreement with results of numerical simulations.

Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices."}

Our framework is based on the Power-Zienau-Woolley representation of quantum electrodynamics, which provides an optimal separation between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom and is therefore particularly well suited for constructing quantum descriptions of polaritonic excitations in strongly dispersive media. Within this formulation, the fundamental electronic oscillator is identified as the bulk plasmon mode, which is nonperturbatively coupled to the radiative continuum of free photon modes. This coupling induces a geometry-dependent renormalization of the bulk plasma frequency, giving rise to confined plasmonic resonances. As specific applications, we recover the localized surface plasmon modes of metallic nanoparticles, including radiative frequency shifts and decay, as well as the exact dispersion relation of propagating surface plasmon polaritons at planar interfaces. Our quantum treatment further reveals that light-matter interactions at metal-dielectric interfaces are inherently in the ultrastrong coupling regime. As a result, in the quasistatic limit, the system exhibits unconventional ground-state quantum fluctuations that can be controlled through the refractive index.

However, achieving arbitrary field conversion typically requires the use of cascaded elements, as intrinsic physical and fabrication constraints fundamentally limit individual devices to a restricted subset of transformations. This results in an overall continuous transformation potentially failing to be continuous at the level of the parameters of the cascade, leading to detrimental engineering consequences such as the introduction of complex, discontinuous aberrations that disrupt important topological properties of the underlying matter field. In this work, we establish a novel mathematical framework for analyzing the topological difficulties that emerge in the decomposition of an overall transformation into individual layers, and for determining the minimal depth required to overcome them. The strategy introduced provides a general pathway for optimizing designs for vectorial field control and matter field generation, with particular significance for the manipulation of topological phases in optical polarization fields, such as Stokes skyrmions, where continuity is of vital importance."}

Band", "Yshai Avishai", "Marek Trippenbach"], "title": "Hysteresis in the complex nonlinear refractive index of a homogeneous and isotropic medium", "comment": "6 pages, 5 eps figures", "summary": "We calculate the permittivity, $ε(ω)$, for a medium with a quadratic electro-optic effect, modeling it as a Duffing oscillator. The nonlinear refractive index $n(ω, E(ω))$ and the nonlinear absorption coefficient $α(ω, E(ω))$ exhibit hysteresis when the light intensity is varied [here $E(ω)$ is the electric field strength at angular frequency $ω$], and when the light frequency is varied. $n(ω, E(ω))$ can be negative when the resonances in the permittivity and permeability are close to one another."}

We derive a general expression for the WDF of any accelerating, diffraction-free beam of arbitrary degree of spatial coherence and find an elegant closed-form expression for the WDF of such beam with a Gaussian energy spectrum of noise. We also show how partially coherent accelerating beams of finite power can be constructed within the Wigner picture."}

The formulation incorporates these losses and exploits multiple degrees of freedom to optimize beam manipulation efficiency within a simple realistic printed-circuit-board (PCB) configuration. Importantly, the various loss mechanisms are analyzed using a judiciously devised equivalent circuit model, providing insights on their respective contributions. We validate our theory by designing, fabricating, and experimentally characterizing an efficient FR4-based anomalous reflection PCB MG, demonstrating good agreement between analytical predictions, full-wave simulations, and laboratory measurements. This work opens avenues for realizing efficient, low-profile, beam manipulation devices at reduced cost, offering practical solutions to mitigate loss limitations in diverse material sets across the electromagnetic spectrum."}
