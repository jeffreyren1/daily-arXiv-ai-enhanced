Abstract: Five-dimensional (5D) optical data storage has emerged as a promising
technology for ultra-high-density, long-term data archiving. However, its
practical realization is hindered by noise and interference during data
readout. In this work, we develop a high-precision mathematical model for
multi-layer 5D optical storage, grounded in the Jones matrix framework, to
accurately capture polarization transformations induced by stacked birefringent
nanostructures. Building on this model, we propose a 20-frame FiLM-conditioned
U-Net algorithm to reconstruct birefringence parameters--specifically,
slow-axis orientation and retardance magnitude-directly from measured intensity
patterns. Trained on both ideal and noisy datasets, the network demonstrates
robust reconstruction performance under challenging measurement conditions.
Compared with conventional frame-based retrieval approaches, our method
achieves over an order-of-magnitude improvement in reconstruction accuracy. The
proposed model and algorithm can be readily integrated into existing 5D optical
readout systems, offering both a solid theoretical foundation and practical
tools for precise data recovery.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright,
ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies.
When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses
with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving
system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in
nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are
orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap
in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis
methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a
diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample
from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental
diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets,
imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the
detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of
the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot.
The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to
data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct
silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a
new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast
phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray
free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.

Abstract: Aluminum nitride (AlN) has emerged as a leading platform for integrated
photonics in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges, particularly for
quantum information applications involving trapped atoms. However, achieving
low propagation loss in tightly confining single-mode AlN waveguides remains a
challenge, especially at sub-micron wavelengths where scattering losses scale
unfavorably. In this work, we present a reproducible and detailed fabrication
process for low-loss AlN waveguides on sapphire, achieving a record loss of
2~dB/cm at 852~nm. Our results are enabled by systematic process optimization
including high-resolution electron beam lithography with shape-based proximity
effect correction, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of \ce{Al2O3} for waveguide
surface passivation, and post-fabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We
provide a study of the contributions of each technique to propagation loss
reduction and support our findings with quantitative loss measurements and
comparison with an exhaustive literature review. This work represents the first
detailed report of ALD passivation and post-cladding RTA applied to AlN
waveguides.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light,
minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining
nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both
fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological
photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models,
new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale.
Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually
considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality,
strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In
this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for
photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that
properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the
interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging
role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological
invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables
alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising
directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and
shaping next-generation photonic devices.

Abstract: Compact, non-volatile optical switches on silicon platforms are essential for
reconfigurable photonics, but the strong anisotropy of silicon waveguides leads
to polarization-dependent performance. In this paper, we propose a
polarization-independent, non-volatile optical switch utilizing low-loss phase
change material (PCM) Sb2S3. By incorporating Sb2S3 into a multimode slot
waveguide, multimode interference can be efficiently tuned for both TE and TM
polarizations, owing to enhanced light-PCM interaction.
Polarization-independent switching is achieved through the optimal design of
the multimode slot waveguide region. The proposed non-volatile switch
demonstrates a crosstalk (CT) < -21.9 dB and insertion loss (IL) < 0.12 dB at
1550 nm with a multimode section length of 9.67 {\mu}m, which may find
promising applications in reconfigurable photonic circuits for on-chip optical
signal processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces offer unique opportunities for wave manipulation,
however, their practical realization is often constrained by the requirement
for in-plane spatial modulation, which necessitates a large number of
time-varying elements. In this work, we introduce an alternative architecture
based on a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic
temporal modulation. Although all metasurfaces share the same modulation
frequency, their individual modulation functions are independently engineered
to achieve a desired complex electromagnetic response. We develop a general
theoretical framework for the design and optimization of such stacked
metasurface systems, composed of dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with
time-varying plasma and/or collision frequencies. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated through the optimization of metasurface designs that
enable magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal
analogue of circulators. Furthermore, we show that a metasurface stack can be
implemented using only a few time-modulated elements embedded within a
parallel-plate waveguide, opening new avenues for extremely compact, versatile,
and scalable spatiotemporal platforms for next-generation photonic and
microwave systems.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for manipulations of a variety of topological states in
fractional optical systems through spiral modulation of the local refraction
index. An analytical approximation, based on a truncated finite-mode system,
and direct simulations reveal that the spiral modulation supports direct mutual
conversion between eigenmodes with topological-charge difference \Delta m=1,
driven by the resonant coupling between the modes and the underlying spiral
modulation. The conversion between eigenmodes with \Delta m=2 requires
involvement of an intermediary mode and precise tuning of the resonance
condition. We further explore the conversion of degenerate modes under the
action of azimuthal modulation. Modulated degenerate modes exhibit incomplete
conversion, evolving into intermediate states with odd parity symmetry.
Finally, we examine nonlinear effects on the spiral-modulation-induced mode
conversion, identifying an essential nonlinearity-induced resonance-frequency
shift that critically affects the conversion efficiency.

Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient
generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In
particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is
notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector
based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb
over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate
the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic
properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9
$\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a
single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup.
Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the
quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This
breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary
techniques developed for optical frequency combs.

Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental
components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information
processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer
a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered
by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we
demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared
(1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain
and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP
$>70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high
single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission
($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3
meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative
lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to
transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon
interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of
$V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with
post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported
indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such
demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as
a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources
with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into
telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

Abstract: Programming photonic integrated hardware often reveals as a challenging task
because of the presence of non-idealities in the photonic chip. These include
fabrication imper- fections and parasitic effects such as thermal crosstalk,
which cause unwanted coupling between control signals. Traditional control
methods based on idealized models often fail to account for these phenomana,
leading to significant discrepancies between the desired and actual circuit
behaviour. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for control- ling
meshes of thermally tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which
exploits a machine learning (ML) model trained to compensate for these
non-idealities by pre- adjusting the electrical power given to integrated phase
shifters. The proposed ML system is assessed using synthetic datasets and
experimentally validated on a 3 x 3 triangular MZI mesh. Results demonstrate
that the data-driven controller significantly improves program- ming accuracy,
offering a robust solution for accurate programming of photonic integrated
circuits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated
circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable
coupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,
their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization
of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating
structures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam
lithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical
dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations
simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high
efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from
increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for
different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,
polarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated
coupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches
that of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization
only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower
refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design
method uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach
that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction
model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures
that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new
possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration,
fabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.

Abstract: Cherenkov radiation enables high-energy particle identification through its
velocity-dependent emission angle, yet conventional detectors fail to detect
momenta beyond tens of GeV/c owing to the absence of natural materials with
near-unity refractive indices. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating
directional Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene
plasmons, excited by a swift charged particle travelling above suspended
monolayer graphene. Crucially, TE graphene plasmons exhibit a near-unity mode
index, sustaining high sensitivity of the Cherenkov angle to relativistic
velocities up to the TeV/c regime. The radiation further maintains exceptional
robustness against particle-graphene separation changes, enabled by the TE
mode's low transverse decay rate. This ultracompact platform is electrically
tunable, allowing on-chip, reconfigurable detection of ultrahigh-energy
particles and extending measurable momenta by two orders of magnitude beyond
existing detectors.

Abstract: Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) have recently emerged in
metaphotonics as resonances that combine ultrahigh quality factors with
near-unity circular polarization. However, these states are typically confined
to the Gamma-point (normal incidence) due to their symmetry-protected origins.
We propose a new mechanism for realizing light-cone-proximal chiral q-BICs at
large oblique angles, enabled by the divergence of the radiative local density
of states near the light cone. Using dielectric metasurfaces with a monoclinic
lattice and broken in-plane mirror symmetry, we demonstrate that tuning the
lattice angle allows for robust control of these resonances. The resulting
chiral q-BICs exhibit near-unity circular dichroism in transmission and fully
circularly polarized emission at angles exceeding 50 degrees from normal. This
approach paves the way for directional chiral lasing at grazing angles and for
photonic devices operating efficiently in off-normal geometries.
