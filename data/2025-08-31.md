<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5D光学存储技术虽然具有超高密度和长期存储潜力，但实际应用中数据读出时存在噪声和干扰问题，亟需解决方案。

Method: 基于Jones矩阵框架建立了多层5D存储的数学模型，并开发了20帧FiLM-conditioned U-Net算法，直接从强度模式重建双折射参数。

Result: 算法在理想和噪声数据集上均表现优异，重建精度比传统方法提高了一个数量级。

Abstract: Five-dimensional (5D) optical data storage has emerged as a promising
technology for ultra-high-density, long-term data archiving. However, its
practical realization is hindered by noise and interference during data
readout. In this work, we develop a high-precision mathematical model for
multi-layer 5D optical storage, grounded in the Jones matrix framework, to
accurately capture polarization transformations induced by stacked birefringent
nanostructures. Building on this model, we propose a 20-frame FiLM-conditioned
U-Net algorithm to reconstruct birefringence parameters--specifically,
slow-axis orientation and retardance magnitude-directly from measured intensity
patterns. Trained on both ideal and noisy datasets, the network demonstrates
robust reconstruction performance under challenging measurement conditions.
Compared with conventional frame-based retrieval approaches, our method
achieves over an order-of-magnitude improvement in reconstruction accuracy. The
proposed model and algorithm can be readily integrated into existing 5D optical
readout systems, offering both a solid theoretical foundation and practical
tools for precise data recovery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为 Dichography 的衍射成像技术，用于从重叠的散射信号中恢复样本的两个独特视图，解决了X射线自由电子激光实验中快速动态无法分辨的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法分离X射线自由电子激光实验中由于探测器速度限制而重叠的衍射信号，需要新技术以实现超快动态的时空分辨。

Method: 使用 Dichography 技术处理时间延迟的双色X射线脉冲产生的衍射图，从叠加信号中恢复样本的两个视图。

Result: 在实验数据中成功恢复氙掺杂超流体氦纳米液滴的结构，并验证了750飞秒内的结构存活；同时成功区分银纳米颗粒的独立图像。

Conclusion: Dichography 技术为纳米材料的超快动态研究提供了新的实验工具，推动了X射线自由电子激光在超快电影捕捉中的应用。

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright,
ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies.
When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses
with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving
system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in
nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are
orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap
in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis
methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a
diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample
from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental
diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets,
imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the
detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of
the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot.
The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to
data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct
silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a
new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast
phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray
free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.

### [3] [Low Loss Aluminum Nitride Waveguide Fabrication: Propagation Loss Reduction Through ALD and RTA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20245)
*Nikolay Videnov,Matthew L. Day,Michal Bajcsy*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 优化氮化铝（AlN）波导制造工艺，实现低损耗（2 dB/cm）波导，用于可见光和紫外光谱范围的集成光子学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlN是量子信息应用中集成光子学的理想平台，但实现低损耗、单模波导仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过高分辨率电子束光刻、原子层沉积（ALD）氧化铝表面钝化和快速热退火（RTA）优化工艺。

Result: 在852 nm波长下实现2 dB/cm的低损耗波导，工艺优化显著降低了传播损耗。

Conclusion: 首次报道了ALD钝化和RTA对AlN波导的优化作用，为低损耗波导制造提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Aluminum nitride (AlN) has emerged as a leading platform for integrated
photonics in the visible and ultraviolet spectral ranges, particularly for
quantum information applications involving trapped atoms. However, achieving
low propagation loss in tightly confining single-mode AlN waveguides remains a
challenge, especially at sub-micron wavelengths where scattering losses scale
unfavorably. In this work, we present a reproducible and detailed fabrication
process for low-loss AlN waveguides on sapphire, achieving a record loss of
2~dB/cm at 852~nm. Our results are enabled by systematic process optimization
including high-resolution electron beam lithography with shape-based proximity
effect correction, atomic layer deposition (ALD) of \ce{Al2O3} for waveguide
surface passivation, and post-fabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA). We
provide a study of the contributions of each technique to propagation loss
reduction and support our findings with quantitative loss measurements and
comparison with an exhaustive literature review. This work represents the first
detailed report of ALD passivation and post-cladding RTA applied to AlN
waveguides.

### [4] [Photonic restricted Boltzmann machine for content generation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20472)
*Li Luo,Yisheng Fang,Wanyi Zhang,Zhichao Ruan*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种光子限制玻尔兹曼机（PRBM），利用光子计算加速Gibbs采样，显著降低了计算复杂度，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统限制玻尔兹曼机（RBM）中的Gibbs采样计算成本高，电子实现存在瓶颈，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过光计算技术实现PRBM，采用高效编码方法，避免了矩阵分解，将Gibbs采样的复杂度从O(N)降至O(1)。

Result: PRBM在二维Ising模型中验证了其功能，并能有效生成和恢复多样化内容（如图像和时间序列）。

Conclusion: PRBM展示了光计算在生成人工智能中的潜力，具有可扩展性和低训练成本的优势。

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向和开放式问题，以推动拓扑纳米光子学的进一步发展。

Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light,
minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining
nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both
fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological
photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models,
new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale.
Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually
considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality,
strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In
this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for
photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that
properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the
interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging
role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological
invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables
alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising
directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and
shaping next-generation photonic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硅波导的强各向异性导致偏振依赖性，限制了可重构光子学的光学开关性能。

Method: 使用Sb2S3相变材料嵌入多模缝隙波导，通过优化设计实现偏振无关的开关性能。

Result: 在1550 nm波长下，串扰<-21.9 dB，插入损耗<0.12 dB，多模区长度仅9.67 μm。

Conclusion: 该开关适用于可重构光子电路中的片上光信号处理，具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Compact, non-volatile optical switches on silicon platforms are essential for
reconfigurable photonics, but the strong anisotropy of silicon waveguides leads
to polarization-dependent performance. In this paper, we propose a
polarization-independent, non-volatile optical switch utilizing low-loss phase
change material (PCM) Sb2S3. By incorporating Sb2S3 into a multimode slot
waveguide, multimode interference can be efficiently tuned for both TE and TM
polarizations, owing to enhanced light-PCM interaction.
Polarization-independent switching is achieved through the optimal design of
the multimode slot waveguide region. The proposed non-volatile switch
demonstrates a crosstalk (CT) < -21.9 dB and insertion loss (IL) < 0.12 dB at
1550 nm with a multimode section length of 9.67 {\mu}m, which may find
promising applications in reconfigurable photonic circuits for on-chip optical
signal processing.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces offer unique opportunities for wave manipulation,
however, their practical realization is often constrained by the requirement
for in-plane spatial modulation, which necessitates a large number of
time-varying elements. In this work, we introduce an alternative architecture
based on a cascade of spatially uniform metasurfaces subjected to periodic
temporal modulation. Although all metasurfaces share the same modulation
frequency, their individual modulation functions are independently engineered
to achieve a desired complex electromagnetic response. We develop a general
theoretical framework for the design and optimization of such stacked
metasurface systems, composed of dense arrays of cylindrical meta-atoms with
time-varying plasma and/or collision frequencies. The effectiveness of the
approach is demonstrated through the optimization of metasurface designs that
enable magnet-free isolation at the fundamental frequency and a temporal
analogue of circulators. Furthermore, we show that a metasurface stack can be
implemented using only a few time-modulated elements embedded within a
parallel-plate waveguide, opening new avenues for extremely compact, versatile,
and scalable spatiotemporal platforms for next-generation photonic and
microwave systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究分数光学系统中拓扑态的操控方法，特别是通过螺旋调制实现模式转换。

Method: 采用解析近似和直接模拟，分析螺旋调制下的模式转换，包括直接和间接转换机制。

Result: 螺旋调制支持∆m=1模式的直接转换，∆m=2需中介模式；非线性效应导致共振频率偏移，影响转换效率。

Conclusion: 螺旋调制是实现分数光学系统中拓扑态操控的有效方法，但转换效率受非线性效应显著影响。

Abstract: We propose a scheme for manipulations of a variety of topological states in
fractional optical systems through spiral modulation of the local refraction
index. An analytical approximation, based on a truncated finite-mode system,
and direct simulations reveal that the spiral modulation supports direct mutual
conversion between eigenmodes with topological-charge difference \Delta m=1,
driven by the resonant coupling between the modes and the underlying spiral
modulation. The conversion between eigenmodes with \Delta m=2 requires
involvement of an intermediary mode and precise tuning of the resonance
condition. We further explore the conversion of degenerate modes under the
action of azimuthal modulation. Modulated degenerate modes exhibit incomplete
conversion, evolving into intermediate states with odd parity symmetry.
Finally, we examine nonlinear effects on the spiral-modulation-induced mode
conversion, identifying an essential nonlinearity-induced resonance-frequency
shift that critically affects the conversion efficiency.

Result: 实现了对太赫兹频率梳的MHz级选择性检测，灵敏度达35.9 fW cm⁻² Hz⁻⁰·⁵。

Conclusion: 该技术标志着太赫兹科学进入量子领域，为高精度光谱学提供了新工具。

Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient
generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In
particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is
notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector
based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb
over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate
the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic
properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9
$\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a
single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup.
Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the
quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This
breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary
techniques developed for optical frequency combs.

### [10] [Toward triggered generation of indistinguishable single-photons from MoTe$_2$ quantum emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20743)
*Paweł Wyborski,Athanasios Paralikis,Pietro Metuh,Martin A. Jacobsen,Christian Ruiz,Niels Gregersen,Battulga Munkhbat*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在双层MoTe₂中通过应变和缺陷工程实现近红外单光子源的方法，展示了高纯度、可调谐性和高不可区分性，为量子通信技术提供了新平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在电信波段工作的单光子源是长距离光量子通信和信息技术的关键。二维过渡金属二硫化物（TMDs）是一个有潜力的平台，但其发展受限于光谱范围和光子不可区分性。

Method: 通过确定性的应变和缺陷工程在双层MoTe₂中生成了近红外量子发射体，并进行静电偏置调控。

Result: 发射体表现出高线性偏振、短寿命、高单光子纯度、窄发射以及可调谐性。双光子干涉测量显示高达40%的Hong-Ou-Mandel可见度。

Conclusion: MoTe₂成为一种可调谐、低噪声、高纯度的单光子源平台，为兼容电信的量子光子技术集成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental
components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information
processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer
a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered
by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we
demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared
(1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain
and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP
$>70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high
single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission
($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3
meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative
lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to
transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon
interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of
$V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with
post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported
indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such
demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as
a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources
with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into
telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.

*Gabriele Cavicchioli,Gabriele Masini,Francesco Maria Sances,Francesco Morichetti,Andrea Melloni*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的数据驱动方法来控制光子集成电路中的非理想效应，提高了编程精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制方法无法有效处理光子芯片中的制造缺陷和热串扰等非理想效应，导致电路行为与预期不符。

Method: 利用机器学习模型，通过预先调整集成相位调制器的电功率来补偿这些非理想效应。

Result: 通过合成数据集和实验验证（3x3三角形MZI网络），证明了该方法的有效性，显著提高了编程准确性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动控制器为光电子集成电路的精确编程提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Programming photonic integrated hardware often reveals as a challenging task
because of the presence of non-idealities in the photonic chip. These include
fabrication imper- fections and parasitic effects such as thermal crosstalk,
which cause unwanted coupling between control signals. Traditional control
methods based on idealized models often fail to account for these phenomana,
leading to significant discrepancies between the desired and actual circuit
behaviour. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for control- ling
meshes of thermally tuneable Mach Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), which
exploits a machine learning (ML) model trained to compensate for these
non-idealities by pre- adjusting the electrical power given to integrated phase
shifters. The proposed ML system is assessed using synthetic datasets and
experimentally validated on a 3 x 3 triangular MZI mesh. Results demonstrate
that the data-driven controller significantly improves program- ming accuracy,
offering a robust solution for accurate programming of photonic integrated
circuits.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出一种全三维、偏振不敏感的光栅耦合器，模拟耦合效率达80%以上，通过多目标拓扑优化设计，适合实际制造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面光栅耦合器对偏振敏感，难以同时优化双偏振效率，导致损耗或需要额外组件。

Result: 设计的光栅耦合器在双偏振下效率均超80%，性能与单偏振最优耦合器相当。

Conclusion: 该研究为三维光子器件提供了新可能性，推动下一代光子学和电子学的发展。

Abstract: Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated
circuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable
coupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,
their basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization
of light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating
structures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam
lithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical
dimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations
simultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high
efficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from
increased losses or require additional filtering components to account for
different polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,
polarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated
coupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches
that of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization
only. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower
refractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design
method uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach
that combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction
model acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures
that the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new
possibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration,
fabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.

Main category: physics.optics

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统切伦科夫探测器因缺乏高折射率材料，无法检测超过数十GeV/c的高能粒子。研究旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 利用悬浮单层石墨烯中的TE等离子体，激发定向切伦科夫辐射，其模式折射率接近1，适用于极高速粒子检测。

Result: TE石墨烯等离子体展示了在TeV/c范围内的切伦科夫角度高灵敏度，且对粒子-石墨烯间距变化表现出极强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该技术为超紧凑、可电调谐的高能粒子检测提供了新平台，将可测动量范围扩展了两个数量级。

Abstract: Cherenkov radiation enables high-energy particle identification through its
velocity-dependent emission angle, yet conventional detectors fail to detect
momenta beyond tens of GeV/c owing to the absence of natural materials with
near-unity refractive indices. We overcome this limitation by demonstrating
directional Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene
plasmons, excited by a swift charged particle travelling above suspended
monolayer graphene. Crucially, TE graphene plasmons exhibit a near-unity mode
index, sustaining high sensitivity of the Cherenkov angle to relativistic
velocities up to the TeV/c regime. The radiation further maintains exceptional
robustness against particle-graphene separation changes, enabled by the TE
mode's low transverse decay rate. This ultracompact platform is electrically
tunable, allowing on-chip, reconfigurable detection of ultrahigh-energy
particles and extending measurable momenta by two orders of magnitude beyond
existing detectors.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新机制，通过利用光锥附近的辐射局域态密度发散，实现了在大斜角度下近光锥的手性准束缚态（q-BICs），并展示了其在光子器件应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对称保护手性q-BICs通常局限于Gamma点（正入射），限制了其在实际应用中的灵活性。研究旨在通过新机制打破这种限制，实现大斜角度下的手性q-BICs。

Method: 采用具有单斜晶格和破缺面内镜对称性的介电超表面，通过调节晶格角度来实现对手性q-BICs的鲁棒控制。

Result: 实验证明，所得手性q-BICs在超过50度的斜角度下表现出近单位的圆二色性和完全圆偏振发射。

Conclusion: 该方法为在大斜角度下实现定向手性激光和高效光子器件提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Chiral quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) have recently emerged in
metaphotonics as resonances that combine ultrahigh quality factors with
near-unity circular polarization. However, these states are typically confined
to the Gamma-point (normal incidence) due to their symmetry-protected origins.
We propose a new mechanism for realizing light-cone-proximal chiral q-BICs at
large oblique angles, enabled by the divergence of the radiative local density
of states near the light cone. Using dielectric metasurfaces with a monoclinic
lattice and broken in-plane mirror symmetry, we demonstrate that tuning the
lattice angle allows for robust control of these resonances. The resulting
chiral q-BICs exhibit near-unity circular dichroism in transmission and fully
circularly polarized emission at angles exceeding 50 degrees from normal. This
approach paves the way for directional chiral lasing at grazing angles and for
photonic devices operating efficiently in off-normal geometries.
