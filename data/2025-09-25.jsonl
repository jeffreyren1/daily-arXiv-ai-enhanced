Using\nCrandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theory and spectral analysis, we establish\nrigorous conditions for both steady-state and Hopf bifurcations. These results\nidentify critical thresholds of policing intensity at which spatially uniform\nequilibria lose stability, leading either to persistent heterogeneous hotspots\nor oscillatory crime-policing cycles. From a criminological perspective, such\nthresholds represent tipping points in guardian mobility: once crossed, they\ncan lock neighborhoods into stable clusters of criminal activity or trigger\nrecurrent waves of hotspot formation. Numerical simulations complement the\ntheory, exhibiting stationary patterns, periodic oscillations, and chaotic\ndynamics.
