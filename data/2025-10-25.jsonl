In\nfact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption\ncan induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed\ninvestigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular,\nfuture scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating\nabsorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a\ncomprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the\nmultilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where\nthe coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary\ncondition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating\ndesign, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results\nreveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the\ncoating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates\nthat temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed\nmodel by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental\nuncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters.

This equivalence is not approximate or analogical\nbut mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form\ndiscovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We\ndemonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and\nrelativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment\nequation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag\ncoefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves\ncouple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics\nreproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical\ninterpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into\nkinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical\ncontent in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's\ndispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity\n(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure\nkinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation\nof dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain\ninsights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking\nacoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces\nindependent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.\nFresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as\naspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical\ndensity-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory.

By the aid of target pattern\nartificially designed in the projection imaging system, the statistical\ndistribution of projection pattern will be highly controllable. In this work,\nwe theoretically point out key factors influencing the g^(2)(0) peak value of\nHBT effect in a single-lens incoherent imaging system. We find the peak value\nis not only decided by statistical property and coherence length of target\npattern but also depends on the intrinsic characteristics of projection system,\nsuch as numerical aperture and projection quality. Then, we experimentally\nmeasured the g^(2)(0) peak value of HBT effect with a phase-only holographic\nprojection scheme and demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical analysis\non the holographic scheme. Here, the super-bunching effect in the projection\nplane has been observed, when target patterns originated from chaotic speckle\nor it's function transformation patterns. Moreover, we design some sparse\ntarget patterns, whose holographic reconstruction patterns show the\nsuper-bunching effect achieving g^(2)(0)=39.77. Finally, we discussed the\npositive influence of holographic noise on increasing the g^(2)(0) peak value.\nThe presented work predicting the peak value of HBT effect not only is\napplicable for the lens imaging system but also in other projection systems,\nsuch as the holographic projection."}

However, their\nintegration faces two fundamental challenges: mode symmetry mismatch with\nconventional waveguides and prohibitive dimensions. We successfully overcome\nthese two critical challenges by introducing a novel valley-ridge gap waveguide\nbased on topological half-supermode engineering. By strategically hybridizing\nridge waveguide modes and valley kink states, we create an exotic odd-symmetric\nsupermode enabling robust propagation and ultra-compact operation. The further\nimplementation of a perfect electric conductor boundary halves lateral\ndimensions while eliminating radiation loss. Crucially, our proposed\nvalley-ridge interface achieves direct transverse electric mode matching with\nstandard waveguides without transition structures, enabling seamless\nintegration. Experimental results demonstrate reflection losses lower than -15\ndB in realistic telecommunication scenarios with super-robust signal\npropagation through sharp bends. This work innovatively conceptualizes\ntopological half-supermodes and pioneers their practical applications for\nintegrated waveguide devices, establishing a completely new waveguide class\nthat uniquely combines robust backscattering immunity with deep subwavelength\ncompactness."}

In\nthis work, we used the multipolar expansion framework for decomposing the\nelectromagnetic scattering by dielectric particles with magnetic properties.\nMagnetization current contributions were explicitly accounted for by using the\nvector spherical harmonics to compute the electric and magnetic multipole\ncontributions of arbitrary order. The exact analytical expressions for the\ncorresponding spherical multipole coefficients were employed, with the\nscattering efficiencies being used to distinguish the dielectric and magnetic\ncontributions of each multipole. This enables the analysis of scattering from\narbitrarily shaped, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous magnetic scatterers. It also\nprovides a tool for studying non-reciprocal devices that exploit magnetic\nresonances in magnetic-dielectric materials. Calculations were made for an\nexperimentally feasible system, namely for ferrite-based scatterers operating\nin the microwave regime. These materials are of interest in radio frequency\n(RF) applications due to their magnetic activity. We demonstrated analytically\nthat the magnetic circular dichroism in a magnetic-dielectric scatterer in the\nFaraday geometry can be decomposed into individual multipole contributions. The\nanalytical results indicate that multipole resonances associated with\nmagnetization currents can be even stronger than multipole contributions from\nconventional dielectric currents.

In\nfact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption\ncan induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed\ninvestigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular,\nfuture scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating\nabsorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a\ncomprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the\nmultilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where\nthe coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary\ncondition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating\ndesign, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results\nreveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the\ncoating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates\nthat temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed\nmodel by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental\nuncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests\nthat computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate\nresults for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses.
