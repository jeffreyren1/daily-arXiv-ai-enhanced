To unravel these relationships, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of \\num{747} experimentally known TADF molecules to establish large-scale, quantitative design principles. Our validated semi-empirical protocol systematically reveals how molecular architecture, conformational geometry, and electronic structure govern photophysical properties. We establish a clear performance hierarchy, with Donor-Acceptor-Donor (D-A-D) architectures being statistically superior for minimizing the singlet-triplet energy gap ($ΔE_{\\text{ST}}$). Crucially, we identify an optimal D-A torsional angle window of \\qtyrange{50}{90}{\\degree} that resolves the key trade-off between a small $ΔE_{\\text{ST}}$ and the non-zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC) required for efficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Data-driven clustering further identifies a distinct family of high-performance candidates and confirms Multi-Resonance (MR) emitters as a unique paradigm for high-efficiency blue emission.

This mechanism is particularly important for low-cycle fatigue, where the accumulation of inelastic strains plays an important role in the progression to final failure. The ratcheting contribution is formulated through the evolution of ratcheting strain, which accumulates over loading cycles and captures the inelastic strain growth characteristic of cyclic plasticity in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The extended plastic potential allows independent control over deviatoric and volumetric ratcheting components, ensuring smooth evolution of the free energy and its derivatives. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the model under both monotonic and cyclic loading and to assess the influence of ratcheting on material response."}

Recently, a composite force sensor based on UCNPs embedded in a polystyrene microbead enabled the first real time measurement of feeding forces in living nematodes. However, the comparatively large stiffness of polystyrene only makes it relevant to biomedical application in a small subset of biological tissue. To facilitate deployment of UCNPs into biological tissues with a range of mechanical properties, we expand upon polymer UCNP composite systems by embedding UCNPs in three polymer matrices with varying stiffnesses (epoxy resin, polydimethylsiloxane, and alginate hydrogels). Furthermore, to enhance these composites mechanosensitivity, we methodically investigate using two different core-shell architectures of SrLuF based UCNPs doped with ytterbium, erbium, and varying manganese concentrations. We calibrate polymer UCNP composite optical force sensitivity with colocalized atomic force and confocal microscopy. Using the red to green emission ratio (Delta Percent IRed:IGreen) as the force read-out, we determine that SrLuF:Yb0.28Er0.025Mn0.013 with SrYF inert shell dispersed in epoxy resin exhibits the greatest emission color change (12 Delta Percent IRed:IGreen per microNewton). Finally, we map forces in the epoxy UCNP composite on the macroscale between the joint of a chicken wing bone using a commercially available wide field microscope, thereby demonstrating its ability to optically measure pressures in situ. This work establishes the utility and modularity of the UCNP polymer composite system for force sensing in geometrically and mechanically diverse biological systems."}

This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading."}

Its realization in a compact footprint, however, is limited by intrinsically weak optical nonlinearities and the enlarged free spectral range that raises the multistability threshold. Here, we overcome this constraint by engineering a pair of spectrally close, ultra-high-Q resonances in a photonic crystal microcavity. Leveraging structural perturbations that deliberately introduce non-Hermitian coupling through a shared radiation channel, we drive the resonances toward an exceptional point with nearly degenerate wavelengths and balanced quality factors approaching $10^6$. This configuration substantially enhances thermo-optical nonlinearity and produces pronounced tristability and hysteresis loops within a footprint of 20 μm at input powers below 240 μW. We further demonstrate proof-of-concept optical random-access memory through controlled switching among multistable states. These results establish a general strategy for nonlinear microcavities to achieve energy-efficient multistability for reconfigurable all-optical memories, logic, and neuromorphic processors."}

A fundamental challenge is the seamless and efficient integration of memory with information processing in a physically interpretable way that enables cognitive learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Prevailing paradigms, from intricate logic cascades to black-box morphological computing or physical neural networks, are seriously limited by trade-offs among efficiency, scalability, interpretability, transparency, and reliance on additional electronics. Here, we introduce in-memory phononic learning, a paradigm-shifting framework that unifies nonvolatile mechanical memory with wave-based perception within a phononic metastructure. Our system encodes spatial information into stable structural states as mechanical memory that directly programs its elastic wave-propagation landscape. This memory/wave-dynamics coupling enables effective sensory perception, decomposing complex patterns into informative geometric features through frequency-selective wave localization. Learning is created by optimizing input waveforms to selectively probe these features for memory-pattern classification, with decisions inferred directly from the output wave energy, thereby completing the entire information loop mechanically through an efficient and physically transparent mechanism without hidden architectures or electronics. This work transcends the paradigm of 'materials that compute' to cognitive matter capable of interpreting dynamic environments, paving the way for future intelligent structural-material systems with low power consumption, more direct interaction with surroundings, and enhanced cybersecurity and resilience in harsh conditions."}

While the effect of this strong coupling on light has been extensively studied, its impact on matter remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate photothermal energy harvesting using strong light-matter interactions in high-quality-factor metasurfaces. First, we show that maximum metasurface temperatures can differ by $90^\\circ C$ based on the spectral excitation pathway: direct excitation of the metasurface from its nominal equilibrium by a single wavelength results in lower metasurface temperatures compared to continuous spectral scans. Investigating the temporal dynamics of this thermo-optic nonlinearity, we show an initial linear rise to a critical temperature over $~10s$ of seconds, followed by a rapid rise to the high temperature steady state in $~33ms$ around the bistable transition point. This linear rise time increases sharply around the bistable transition point. Most significantly, we show emergence of a Q-factor-dependent temperature band splitting and energy gap of around $60^\\circ C$ between the critical temperature and the high temperature steady state of the metasurface under single wavelength illumination. This forbidden equilibrium temperature band signifies that the high temperature steady state of the metasurface resonance after transitioning across the laser wavelength is further away from its nominal resonance than its linewidth. Interestingly, hyperspectrally accumulated nonlinearities from prior wavelengths effectively dope the metasurface with optical states within this bandgap. These thermal nonlinearities are tunable using the geometry and material of the metasurface. Collectively, these results show how high-Q metasurfaces enable strongly localized, path-dependent photothermal heating to drive site-selective on-chip catalytic and biochemical transformations."}

Using time- and phase-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy and time-resolved scanning transmission microscopy, we show that magnon-polaritons can propagate faster than 100 km/s, nearly three orders of magnitude more than conventional spin waves, and can be observed at distances exceeding 40 micrometers in 20 nm thick films. Analytical modeling based on retarded Maxwell equations and Polder tensor formalism confirms the hybridized nature of the excitations and captures the nontrivial dispersion and attenuation profiles. Notably, the magnon-polaritons maintain high initial magnetization amplitudes and long decay lengths, enabling ultrafast manipulation of the magnetization far away from the excitation source.

These calibration techniques are well documented for standalone FTIR instruments but not for microscope coupled-FTIRs, even though such an architecture greatly simplifies collection of light from micro and nano scale structures.

The WVA protocol, employing real weak values, amplifies the minute delay induced by sample perturbation, thereby translating it into a measurable shift of interference fringes. However, this amplification introduces significant fringe distortion. To address this, we deploy deep learning architectures as high-precision parameter estimators: a convolutional neural network regressor (CNN-Regressor) for direct delay estimation and a classifier (CNN-Classifier) for discrete delay categorization. These are systematically benchmarked against traditional Fourier-transform-based analysis. Two key conclusions are drawn: (i) The WVA technique consistently enhances measurement precision across all estimators by effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). (ii) Both deep learning models surpass the traditional FFT approach; the CNN-Regressor achieves a higher SNR at small weak values, while the CNN-Classifier enables accurate estimation even under a challenging \"$π$ phase shift\" condition where conventional analysis fails. This synergistic combination of WVA and deep learning establishes a powerful framework for attosecond metrology, paving the way for enhanced precision in ultrafast spectroscopy."}

In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of π/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling. The influence of intracavity length on the PSHE is further explored, providing an additional parameter for fine-tuning the transverse shift.

Integration of lithium niobate into optical devices, however, is hampered by significant top-down fabrication challenges due to its exceptional chemical resistance. Scalable fabrication methods that preserve material quality while reducing fabrication complexity and cost are, therefore, crucial to advancing lithium niobate devices. We present a photochemical metal-organic decomposition technique for the scalable patterning of lithium niobate at ambient conditions, eliminating the need for harsh etching conditions and cleanroom protocols. The method utilizes a solution of a custom-prepared photosensitive organometallic precursor as a negative photoresist. The UV light exposure of the thin films of the precursor through a photomask, followed by rinsing with ethanol, yields amorphous patterns, which transform into crystalline lithium niobate after a calcination step. This method enables a scalable fabrication of a range of complex geometric shapes with a feature resolution down to $30\\,μ\\mathrm{m}$. The patterned lithium niobate structures exhibit a tunable second harmonic generation activity with an isotropic optical response. This approach offers a scalable and low-cost pathway for manufacturing lithium niobate photonics and the potential to fabricate other materials (e.g., barium titanite and lithium tantalate)."}

This study presents a differentiable inverse design framework for such metasurfaces, creating an accurate mapping between meta-atom geometries and their multi-channel optical responses across diverse optical dimensions. Using a deep neural network-driven, end-to-end optimization pipeline, the framework enables intelligent, iterative refinement of rotatable metasurface within constrained design space. Using this approach, we show high-fidelity holographic video display by rotating a single element in a cascaded metasurface doublet around the optical axis. The doublet enables pixel-resolved holographic imaging with 288 independent channels, and by switching input/output polarization states, the system demonstrates four distinct full-color dynamic holographic videos. This work establishes an alternative paradigm for optical parameter multiplexing and end-to-end inverse design in mechanically reconfigurable metasurfaces, suggesting applications in compact optical systems, dynamic holography, information processing, and optical computing."}

The approach is based on constructing a Hamiltonian as the square root of a supersymmetric partner energy-shifted by a constant. This formulation naturally leads to bipartite dynamics with balanced gain and loss and can incorporate non-reciprocal couplings. The resulting systems exhibit entirely real spectra over a finite parameter range precisely when the corresponding passive Hamiltonian lacks a zero mode. As the non-Hermitian parameter representing gain and loss increases, the spectrum undergoes controlled real-to-complex transitions at second-order exceptional points. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework through several examples, including well-known models such as the Hatano--Nelson (HN) and complex Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (cSSH) lattices. Extending the formalism to $q$-commuting matrices further enables the systematic realization of higher-order exceptional points in systems with unidirectional couplings. Overall, this work uncovers new links between non-Hermitian physics and supersymmetry, offering a practical route to engineer photonic arrays with tunable spectral properties beyond what is achievable with explicit $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry."}

Inverse-designed photonics, empowered by optimization and learning algorithms, have emerged as a powerful paradigm for realizing compact and multifunctional integrated photonic components. In this work, we develop a staged-annealing topological optimization (SATO) framework tailored for the design of integrated terahertz (THz) beam-shaping devices. Employing this inverse-designed framework, we experimentally demonstrate a class of compact THz vortex beam emitters on an all-silicon on-chip platform. These devices efficiently convert the in-plane fundamental transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode into free-space vortex beams with mode purity up to 87% and energy conversion efficiency up to 74% across the target wavelength range (680 μm to 720 μm). The inverse-designed emitters exhibit ultracompact footprints (lateral size < 4λ) and a free-standing configuration, enabling the generation of dual-directional vortex beams carrying opposite topological charges. The proposed SATO framework provides a generalizable and fabrication-compatible approach for THz photonic device engineering, offering a scalable pathway toward complex structured beam manipulation in next-generation wireless communication systems and on-chip integrated THz photonic systems."}

The device supports two distinct localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) modes for forward transmission, corresponding to the polarization-dependent (M1) and the polarization-independent (M2) resonances, respectively. This results in the fact that when x-polarized light is incident, only M2 exists; when y-polarized light is incident, both M1 and M2 exist. Besides, both modes yield the maximum isolation ratio of more than 10 dB. The electric field distributions further indicate that M2 exhibits strong confinement and efficient tunneling through the metallic film, while M1 shows weaker but more polarization-sensitive hybridization. The coexistence and tunability of these two modes constitute the physical basis of dual-mode AT, highlighting the AO-GFG structure as a promising platform for high-isolation and polarization-tunable plasmonic devices in the visible and near-infrared regions."}

Spontaneously oriented organic thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition offer a promising poling-free and scalable approach. This study investigates molecular engineering strategies to enhance the second-order nonlinear response of derivatives based on the donor-acceptor molecule 2-(4'-diphenylaminobiphenyl-4-yl)quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (TPA-QCN). Four derivatives incorporating modifications designed to increase molecular hyperpolarizability ($β$) or promote favorable orientation were synthesized and characterized. The most successful modification, intramolecular bridge-locking, simultaneously increases hyperpolarizability and enhances spontaneous orientation by reducing detrimental electrostatic interactions during deposition. It leads to a significant enhancement of the second-order nonlinear response, achieving off-resonance $χ^{(2)}_{31} \\approx 16$ pm V$^{-1}$ and $χ^{(2)}_{33} \\approx 18$ pm V$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm, a twofold improvement over the parent TPA-QCN. Analysis combining nonlinear optical measurements, surface potential measurement, optical anisotropy, and density functional theory calculations indicates that improved molecular orientation, rather than increased $β$ alone, is the primary driver for the enhanced performance in the leading derivatives. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of targeting molecular orientation via structural design and position spontaneously oriented organic films as compelling poling-free candidates for integrated nonlinear photonic applications where the increased electrode-induced optical losses, fabrication complexity and footprint are a critical limitation."}

This study develops and demonstrates a cubic photoelastic model that enables accurate fringe-order estimation from three orthogonal views, providing a foundation for reconstructing full three-dimensional stress states. A transparent, low-elasticity epoxy cube, free of prestress, was fabricated and examined using combined transmission and reflection photoelastic imaging. Three mutually orthogonal isochromatic fringe fields were recorded simultaneously under a single applied load. Image analysis employed a peak-valley intensity method to extract sub-fringe orders and to resolve low-stress cases with minimal noise. The cubic block produced high-quality fringe patterns in all directions, enabling separation of tangential and normal stress components. Independent orthogonal views confirmed directional sensitivity and yielded consistent fringe-order estimates under low loading, with response times on the order of tens of microseconds. These results establish a practical approach for three-dimensional photoelastic stress measurement from orthogonal views and create a pathway toward full vector force reconstruction with strong potential for biomedical applications and studies of dynamic loading."}
