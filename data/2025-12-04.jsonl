We consider triangular riblets with tip angle $90^o$ (T9), that increase drag, with viscous-scaled spacing $50$. A novel grid-generation approach is developed for unstructured spectral-element codes, consistent with the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. We generate a ZPG TBL upstream of the step change (with thickness $δ_0$) with momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} \\simeq 680$. The TBL departure from equilibrium due to the step change, and its subsequent relaxation, recall previous studies on step changes in surface roughness. Downstream of the R-S step change, the internal equilibrium layer thickness $δ_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 δ_0$ within $12δ_0$. However, downstream of the S-R step change $δ_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 δ_0$ within $4δ_0$. In all cases, $δ_{IEL}$ does not reach the boundary layer thickness, even up to a distance of $45δ_0$ downstream of the step change, owing to persistent history effects within the frozen wake region."}

Our setup follows the separating TBL study of Wu et al.\\ ({\\it J. Fluid Mech.}, vol.\\ 883, 2020, p.\\ A45). An equilibrium zero pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL is generated at a reference location, followed by imposition of a Gaussian suction profile to create a separation bubble. The ZPG TBLs over the riblets and the benchmark smooth case have matched momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} = 583$ (friction Reynolds number 224). We employ a well-validated spectral-element solver, and leverage its unstructured-grid nature to generate an optimal grid, based on the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. At the reference location, the T9 and T6 riblets respectively increase and reduce drag, with viscous-scaled spacings $52$ and $13$. We discover that for both riblet cases, the mean separation location occurs at a distance of $140θ_0$ downstream of the reference location, $18\\%$ shorter than the mean separation distance for the smooth case ($170θ_0$). This outcome is related to the progressive enhancement of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers over the riblets, owing to the continuous rise in the adverse pressure-gradient. The KH rollers penetrate into the turbulent separation bubble, with significantly larger size and coherence compared to their counterparts upstream of the mean separation location."}

Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."}

This paper presents the first experimental results on the nature of the wave response excited by striker impact on strongly nonlinear weakly dissipative discrete chains assembled from cylinders with flat ends and spheres having similar masses depending on the ramp time of the incoming pulse. Variation of the pulse ramp time was accomplished using \"hard\" and \"soft\" striker impact. In the case of \"hard\" impact, the incoming pulse with relatively short ramp time was split into Nesterenko solitary waves after traveling about 20 particles as in previous publications. The \"soft\" impact by the same striker with the same velocity was achieved by placing a small mass PTFE spherical particle inside a PTFE O-ring at the top of the first cylinder resulting in significantly longer ramp time of incoming pulse. The incoming pulse generated by \"soft\" impact did not split into a train of solitary waves despite the initial steepening of the leading front due to strong nonlinearity. Instead, it traveled as a shock-like stress wave a long distance of 131 particles. Thus, the generation of a train of solitary waves or shock-like stress wave in a weakly dissipative, strongly nonlinear discrete chain depends on the duration of the incoming pulse ramp. Ramping incoming pulse resulted in dramatic decrease of shock-like stress wave amplitude in comparison with amplitude of the leading solitary wave in case of \"hard\" impact."}

Here we report a monolithic, inverse-designed potassium bromide (KBr) lens that achieves broadband, near-achromatic focusing from 0.45 to 14 $μ$m, a continuous spectral span covering the visible, near-, mid-, and long-wave infrared. This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging. Coupling the KBr lens with a conventional refractive element further yields a hybrid telescope that extends these capabilities. By uniting inverse design with scalable manufacturing, this approach provides a route toward broadly deployable ultra-broadband imagers for biomedicine, climate and environmental monitoring, and space-based sensing."}

The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking. Two types of injection structures were performed. The maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz was achieved at an injection ratio of 0.2. The weight and volume of the proposed injection-locked magnetron system were reduced to 28% and 16%, respectively. The magnetron output is successfully locked by an external signal. The experiment results reveal that the proposed low-cost injection-locked oven magnetron system works reliably.

In this work, we create access to the disconnected water pockets in concentrated slurry waste, facilitating faster water conduction and efficient evaporation at extremely high solid concentration. The evaporator's long roots effectively extracted water beneath 150 cm deep supernatant water layer. Through replantation of the evaporator to a separate location, an impressive evaporation rate (ER) of 4 kg/(m^2*h) close to 80 wt% solid concentration, a 25% increase to a non-replanted sample. Furthermore, long periods of efficient of evaporation was achieved even at high solid concentration through hydrodynamic flushing of roots. Outdoor experiments achieved substantial volumetric reduction, yielding dried residues with over 75 wt% solid concentration. These results underscore the system's reliable performance against highly concentrated slurries, yet to be by conventional industrial methods, including flocculation and tail-lift drying.

We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements.

It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space.

However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz.

Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum.

Because the conversion relies on spin-current injection across a nanometre-thin magnetic layer, its efficiency is ordinarily limited by weak optical coupling. Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack. This demonstration points to a viable pathway toward highly efficient spintronic terahertz emitters with potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and ultrafast technologies."}

It is assumed that on-off keying (OOK) modulation with direct detection is utilized to establish a duplex communication link. A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades. The use of multi-wavelength beam is shown to enhance performance by a sizable margin."}

Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+δn\\cos(Ωt)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \\textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{PT}}(Δ,γ,κ)$ that is strictly $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $Δ=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements. These results establish temporal non-Hermiticity as a new paradigm for dynamically reconfigurable, broadband, and geometry-independent exceptional-point photonics."}

The metalens consists of unit cells, each containing a thin silicon rod. Lumerical FDTD software is used to create a detailed library that connects the dimensions of these nanorods with their respective phase shifts and reflectance properties. The nanorods are placed on a 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, with a 50 nm thick gold (Au) reflective layer underneath. In contrast to conventional transmissive metalenses, our design accomplishes complete 2π phase control via geometry-optimized silicon nanorods, facilitating compact reflective optics. By carefully examining the impact of nanorod dimensions on optical performance, the main goal is to optimize the metalens design for enhanced light focusing and manipulation, which could benefit imaging systems, optical communications, and sensor technology."}

We analytically demonstrate nondiffractive propagating spin merons, independent of whether the field is transverse or longitudinal, with their sign controlled by the wavefront helicity. Experimental confirmation is provided in acoustics through full three-dimensional measurements of the velocity vector field. Although these phenomena are intrinsic to vortex cores, we also show that the claimed universality breaks down for higher-order topological charges, depending on the carrier mode, here exemplified using the Bessel framework."}

For decades, generating polarization entangled states has been mainly achieved using bulk crystals with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), preventing scalability and on-chip integration. Miniaturizing the quantum source provides access to more versatility and tunability while enabling an easier integration to other devices, notably necessary for satellite-based quantum communication, and eventually reducing fabrication costs. This challenging task can be achieved with Zinc Blende GaAs nanowires. They already have shown an efficient photon pairs generation via SPDC at 1550 nm. Here we demonstrate that a pair of orthogonal GaAs nanowires constitutes a new nanoscale platform to control the quantum state at telecommunication wavelength, enabling a transition from polarization entangled to separable states as a function of the pump polarization, with fidelities reaching 90%"}

Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."}
