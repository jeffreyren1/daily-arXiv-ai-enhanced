However, incomplete capture and reversal of\nscattered waves often limits pulse recompression. We address this challenge for\nspatially extended sources by introducing a generalized time-reversal\nframework, which identifies the optimal source pattern as the one that\nmaximizes the energy of the waves that are captured and reversed. In a\ntwo-dimensional diffusive waveguide, we reconstruct the time-reversed wavefront\ncorresponding to this optimal source using spatiospectral shaping, leading to a\n35-fold enhancement in peak transmitted power compared to an unmodulated pulse.\nInternal spatiotemporal measurements reveal a ``loading and firing\" process, in\nwhich energy accumulates within the medium and then is released abruptly.\nMoreover, time-reversing this burst enables deep energy delivery into the\nscattering medium. Generalized time-reversal opens new possibilities for\nshort-pulse control in strongly-scattering media, with applications ranging\nfrom optogenetics to random laser amplification."}

Introducing a twist angle or\nlattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moir\\'e potential that\nsignificantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional\ncomplexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have\nenabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such\nmoir\\'e-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing\nboth their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we\naddress this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body\nmodel that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully\naccounting for the moir\\'e potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band\nstructure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap\nexcitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive\nbehavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise\nto a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics\ncreating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms\nbehind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton\ntransport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for\nnext-generation moir\\'e-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies."}

Here, we demonstrate\nrecord-breaking, non-volatile control of optical anisotropy in two-dimensional\nReS2 via ferroelectric gating with aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). Our\nferroelectric field-effect transistors achieve near-unity (~95%) LD tunability\nof differential reflectance at room temperature--the highest reported for any\nelectrically controlled 2D optical system. Crucially, the programmed optical\nstates exhibit exceptional retention exceeding 12,000 seconds without applied\nbias, enabling true non-volatile optical memory. Through combined experimental\ncharacterization and ab initio calculations, we reveal that ferroelectric\npolarization switching induces substantial asymmetric charge transfer to ReS2,\nselectively populating conduction band states and triggering structural\ndistortions that dramatically enhance optical anisotropy in the \"up\"\npolarization state while leaving the \"down\" state unperturbed. This\nferroelectric-semiconductor coupling provides a universal platform for\nvoltage-programmable, energy-efficient photonic devices with dynamic\npolarization control, addressing critical needs in integrated photonics as well\nas programmable far-field optics and telecommunications infrastructure."}
