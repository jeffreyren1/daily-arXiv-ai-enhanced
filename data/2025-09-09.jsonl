Although typical models for\nnon-Hermitian photonic matter are often single mode, photonic systems are often\nmultimodal, producing mixing between different normal modes in each site. In\nthis work, we explore a generalized family of multimodal non-Hermitian\nlattices, featuring multiple resonant modes. We show that these multimodal\nmodels are capable of featuring topological modes and criticality, similar to\nthe artificial single-mode models often considered. We analyze the robustness\nof these non-Hermitian topological modes to fluctuation of local losses,\ndisorder, and artificial gauge field. We show that these effects can be\ncaptured via both a full microscopic model and effective multiorbital models.\nSpecifically, we show that due to their multiorbital nature, the localization\nproperties of non-Hermitian multiorbital models can be controlled by an\nexternal gauge field. Our results demonstrate that internal orbital degrees of\nfreedom provide a promising strategy to engineer controllable non-Hermitian\ntopology and criticality."}

Its flexibility makes it attractive for multiple industrial\napplications, e.g., in aerospace, automotive and biomedical fields. However,\nerrors or defects introduced at any stage of the printing process can, if\nundetected, significantly impact the final result, rendering the printed part\nunusable. Potential in-situ correction methods of printing defects require fast\nand high-resolution on-the-fly 3D inspection inside the machine, but existing\n3D monitoring methods often lack full 360{\\deg} 3D coverage, require bulky\nsetups, or are too slow for real-time layer-wise feedback. In this paper, we\npresent a single-shot, multi-view polarized fringe projection profilometry\n(FPP) system designed for real-time in-situ 3D inspection during DED printing.\nMultiple camera-projector pairs are arranged around the deposition surface to\nmeasure depth from different viewpoints in single-shot, while cross-polarized\nimage filtering suppresses specular reflections caused by varying surface\nreflectance across different alloys. The final 360{\\deg} reconstruction is\nobtained via joint registration of the captured multi-view measurements. Our\nprototype has been deployed in a DED system and our first experiments\ndemonstrate a depth precision better than $\\delta z < 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ on\npartially reflective and \"shiny\" metal surfaces, enabling accurate, layer-wise\nmonitoring for closed-loop DED control."}
