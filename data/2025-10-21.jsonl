In each method,\nour analysis highlights the trade-offs between resolution, field of view, and\nsegmentation efficiency. Additionally, we integrate deep learning segmentation\nthresholding to improve the image analysis process. Thanks to its large field\nof view, microtomography with classical sources is ideal for the analysis of\nrelatively long fiber spans, where a low spatial resolution is acceptable. The\nother way around, nanotomography has the highest spatial resolution, but it is\nlimited to very small fiber samples, e.g., fiber tapers and nanofibers, which\nhave diameters of the order of a few microns. Finally, X-ray microscopy\nprovides a good compromise between the sample size fitting the device's field\nof view and the spatial resolution needed for properly imaging the inner\nfeatures of the fiber.

Unlike conventional dispersive sensing that\ntracks resonance frequency shifts, our approach leverages enhanced local fields\nand thermal effects at the coupling region to convert weak absorption into\nmeasurable variations in resonance depth. A modulation-demodulation method\nsuppresses low-frequency noise, with parameters optimized experimentally. The\nsensor achieves quantitative detection over 1.5-400 ppm (R2 > 0.99), ~1.13%\naccuracy, a minimum detection limit of 0.12 ppb at 424 s integration-five\norders of magnitude better than dispersive WGM sensors. Long term CO2\nmonitoring further demonstrates stability and resistance to environmental\nperturbations. Compared with state-of-the-art cavity-enhanced and photoacoustic\nsensors, our system delivers at least an order of magnitude lower baseline\ndetection while maintaining compact size, ambient pressure operation, and low\ncost, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-world deployment."}

Downsizing the\ncouplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density\nintegration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems.\nHowever, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level\ndemonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further\nimprovement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design\nsingle-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating\nbottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of\ncouplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of\nmere 14 $\\mu$m $\\times$ 14 $\\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode\nfibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the\nmeasured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers\nis -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band. Our\ndemonstration provides a coupling solution for photonic applications requiring\nhigh efficiency and high-density integration, such as spatial division\nmultiplexing and photonic quantum technologies."}

The window incorporates pyramidal anti-reflection (AR)\nstructures, machined directly into the polyethylene using CNC machining, which\nprovide impedance matching over a broad frequency range. The structured UHMWPE\nmethod was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a\ncryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides\nmechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We\ncharacterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain\nSpectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\\%$ across the\nfull band.

While\ninverse-design algorithms have advanced thermoplasmonic metasurfaces, their\nextension to all-dielectric systems has not been explored. Here, an inverse\nthermal design framework is introduced for dielectric metasurfaces composed of\nthermo-optical amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanoresonators. By leveraging a\nprecomputed library of absorption spectra as a function of geometry and\ntemperature, target thermal profiles are directly mapped onto metasurfaces,\nenabling both uniform and complex temperature shaping. Unlike plasmonic\nplatforms that require multi-resonator unit cells for tunability, dielectric\nnanoresonators provide intrinsic reconfigurability: at wavelengths where the\nthermo-optical coefficient is negligible (e.g., ~500 nm), absorption is\ntemperature-invariant, whereas at other wavelengths it becomes strongly\ntemperature-dependent, allowing illumination intensity to reshape the thermal\nlandscape. This multifunctionality permits a single metasurface to yield\ndistinct profiles under different excitation conditions without added\nstructural complexity. As a proof of concept, photothermal catalysis on such\nmetasurfaces is modeled, predicting over 30% enhancement in reaction rates. The\npresented framework establishes a scalable strategy for engineering nanoscale\ntemperature fields with broad implications for catalysis, thermal management,\nand photothermal energy conversion."}

This study\npresents, for the first time, integrated Huygens'-based microring resonators\nand directional and contra-directional couplers, specifically designed for\noperation at the 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength. By leveraging the unique\nproperties of resonant Huygens' waveguides, we demonstrate efficient evanescent\ndirectional coupling with high-Q resonators, characterized by negative group\nindex and near-zero dispersion, which are critical for enhancing performance in\ncompact, high-performance add-drop filters.

Notably, the introduction of a\nhybrid subwavelength grating-Huygens' contra-directional coupler facilitates\nbackward coupling between resonant and non-resonant metawaveguides, achieving a\nbroad spectral rejection bandwidth.
