By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart.

We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\\mathrm{μm}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $μ(t) = μ_0 \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\big( - (t/τ)^β \\big) \\right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $τ= 6$--$50~\\mathrm{μm}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $λ_D < τ\\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \\gtrsim 3τ$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies."}

Draft submitting for \"Optics and Lasers in Engineering.\"", "summary": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable."}

Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications."}

It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative. The results obtained are qualitatively consistent with the available experimental data."}

Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields."}

Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 μm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 μm to 200 μm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability."}

Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.\n  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research."}

Exploiting the strong Raman activity and high second-order nonlinearity of LNOI, we engineered a dispersion-optimized microring with a loaded Q factor of 3.86X10^6, facilitating on-chip efficient broadband coherent light source. A novel phase-matching configuration with all the waves of the same ordinary polarization was realized for the first time in this platform, feasibly enabling modal-phase matched Raman-quadratic nonlinear processes that extend lasing signals into the visible spectrum.

The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions."}

Thus, there is high demand for nondestructive techniques that enable rapid analysis of natural and synthetic diamonds as well as diamond-like simulants. Here, we demonstrate sub-micrometer, nondestructive, three-dimensional imaging and spectral analysis of diamonds using multiphoton microscopy (MPM). This approach stimulates nonlinear optical emissions to provide unique insights into the interior structure, fluorescent defects, and formational conditions of diamonds. As a result, MPM can be used to investigate gemstone quality, vacancy centers used in quantum technologies, and the various inclusions and fluorescent emitters that may trace gemstone provenance and treatment history."}

We describe three typical spectral scenarii encountered in this method: spectra exhibiting numerous interference fringes, spectra with a moderate number of peaks, and spectra with only a few identifiable features, providing illustrative examples for each case. We also discuss the main limitations of the technique, including spectral range constraints, the necessity of knowing the refractive index, and the influence of spectral resolution and signal quality. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the method in a time-resolved study of a TTAB (tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide) foam film undergoing elongation and thinning. This method can be adapted to measure any thin non-opaque layer."}

Achieving this necessitates the heterogeneous integration of different elements onto a single interposer chip. Integrated quantum emitters are key enablers for generating single photons, inducing quantum nonlinearities, and producing entanglement. In this work, we demonstrate the scalable integration of mature InGaAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides onto a low-loss SiN photonic platform, as evidenced by a high processing yield of 94.7% using a commercially available micro-transfer printing tool. These integrated emitters are embedded within a p-i-n heterostructure that allows for noise suppression, near-blinking-free operation and wavelength tunability upon CMOS-level electrical biasing. With this, we pave the way for scalable integration of diverse quantum photonic devices on a single chip."}
