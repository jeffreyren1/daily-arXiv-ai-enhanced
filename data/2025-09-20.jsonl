To extend beyond natural\nsynthesis, the design of functional metamaterials requires the solution of two\ninverse problems, i.e., modulating the spatial distribution of physical\nproperties to achieve target functionalities, and generating geometric\nstructures to realize the desired physical property distribution. Until now,\nrealizing special functionalities from metamaterials primarily relies on the\nprocess of joining individual 'building blocks' of functional materials, which\nare deliberately designed to attain required responsive behaviors, such as the\nnon-uniform displacement field. However, the discontinuity of the physical\nproperty distribution between the building blocks in the resulted structure,\noften leads to problems such as excessive stress concentration in the joining\nareas and limited design flexibility. To overcome the above problems, we\nproposed a new method for automatic design of functional metamaterials to\nachieve continuity in both geometry and physical properties.
