However, conventional wisdom - the coupled\noscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent\nemissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the\nrole of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior.\nIn this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the\nconventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective\nand coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these\ninteractions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive\ninterference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and\nphotonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the\ncontinuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a\nunified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design\nprinciples for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored\nradiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and\nquantum polaritonic applications."}

The\nexperimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain\noverall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest\nBLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive\nperformance in specific scenarios.

It requires, however,\nto be warm--started from an initial state with sufficiently high overlap with\nthe ground state. For strongly-correlated states, where QPE is expected to have\nadvantage over classical methods, preparation of such initial states requires\ndeep quantum circuits and/or expensive hybrid quantum-classical optimization.\nIt is well-known that orbital-optimized paired Coupled Cluster Doubles\n(oo-pCCD) method can describe the static correlation features of many strongly\ncorrelated singlet states. We show that pCCD and its unitary counterpart,\nUpCCD, become equivalent in the limit of small amplitudes if the amplitude\nmatrix is sufficiently sparse. We demonstrate that substituting leading oo-pCCD\namplitudes into the UpCCD Ansatz allows to prepare high-fidelity singlet states\nfor models of multiple-bond dissociation in ethene, ethyne and dinitrogen, as\nwell as for 1D Hubbard models at half-filling, with very shallow circuits.

During compilation, the virtual qubits of the\ngates are assigned to the physical qubits of the underlying quantum hardware, a\nstep often referred to as the qubit assignment problem. To ensure that the\nresulting circuit respects hardware connectivity constraints, additional SWAP\ngates are inserted as needed, which is known as the qubit routing problem.\nTogether, they are called the Qubit Mapping Problem (QMP), which is known to be\nNP-hard. A very common way to deal with the complexity of the QMP is to\npartition the sequence of gates into a sequence of gate groups (or layers).\nHowever, this imposes a couple of important restrictions: (1) SWAP gates can\nonly be added between pairs of consecutive groups, and (2) all the gates\nbelonging to a certain group have to be executed (in parallel) in the same time\nslot. The first one prevents gates to be re-arranged optimally, while the\nsecond one imposes a time discretization that practically ignores gate\nexecution time. While this clearly reduces the size of the feasible space,\nlittle is still known about how much is actually lost by imposing a fixed\nlayering when looking at the minimization of either the number of SWAPs or the\nmakespan of the compiled circuit. In this paper, we present a flexible branch\nand bound algorithm for a generalized version of the QMP that either considers\nor ignores the gate layering and the gate execution time. The algorithm can\nfind find proven optimal solutions for all variations of the QMP, but also\noffers a great platform for different heuristic algorithms. We present results\non several benchmark sets of small quantum circuits, and we show how ignoring\nthe layering can significantly improve some key performance indicators of the\ncompiled circuit."}

To counter these vulnerabilities, we propose straightforward and\nhighly effective countermeasures including high-speed photodiodes for real-time\npower monitoring and targeted spectral filtering to detect and suppress\nout-of-band signals.
