This study proposes a broadband tunable microwave photonic radar system that can simultaneously monitor respiration, heartbeat, and speech. The system works by generating broadband radar signals to detect subtle skin displacements caused by these physiological activities. It then utilizes phase variations in radar echo signals to extract and reconstruct the corresponding physiological signals. In order to enhance the processing capability for speech signals, a convolutional neural network with a dual-channel feature fusion model is incorporated, enabling high-precision speech recognition. In addition, the system's frequency-tunable characteristic allows it to flexibly switch frequency bands to adapt to different working environments, greatly improving its practicality and environmental adaptability. In concept-verification experiments, speech signals were reconstructed and recognized in the Ku, K, and Ka bands, achieving recognition accuracies of 97.20%, 98.07%, and 97.43%, respectively. The system's capability to detect multimodal vital signs was also thoroughly validated using a respiratory and heartbeat simulator. During a 20-second monitoring period, while accurately reconstructing speech, the maximum average error counts for respiratory and heartbeat monitoring were 0.39 and 0.87, respectively, proving its reliability and effectiveness in multimodal vital sign monitoring."}

In discrete lattices, however, its realization can deviate markedly from the continuous case, especially in the presence of nontrivial momentum-space band touchings. Here, we investigate angular momentum conservation associated with quadratic band-touching points (QBTPs) in two-dimensional lattices. We show that, unlike in graphene lattices hosting linear band-touching points (LBTPs), the conventional angular momentum is no longer conserved near QBTPs. Instead, we identify a generalized total angular momentum (GTAM) that remains conserved for both LBTPs and QBTPs, inherently determined by the topological winding number at the band-touching point (BTP). Using a photonic Kagome lattice, we experimentally demonstrate GTAM conservation through pseudospin-orbital angular momentum conversion. Furthermore, we show that this conservation principle extends to a broad class of discrete lattices with arbitrary pseudospin textures and higher-order winding numbers. These results reveal a fundamental link between pseudospin, angular momentum, and topology, establishing a unified framework for angular-momentum dynamics in discrete systems."}

Simulated results demonstrate a reduction in the coefficient of variation (COV) of potato temperature from 0.694 to 0.461, indicating enhanced heating uniformity while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, the measured potato temperatures show excellent agreement with the simulated results, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Optical computing has been positioned as a new computing solution, promising high speed and energy efficiency by exploiting the available degrees of freedom of light. Although solutions exist in the optical domain, there is a continuous search for compact solutions that properly utilize the limited chip space and exploit various degrees of freedom of light. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a compact, programmable photonic integrated circuit (PIC) architecture that operates on both spatial and frequency degrees of freedom by leveraging embedded optical feedback loops. This architecture enables universal linear unitary transforms by combining resonators with passive linear mixing layers and tunable active phase layers. The strong dispersion achieved from the resonant loops enables multi-frequency operation and reduces the number of required active layers to achieve universality. This solution reduces the optical port requirements, minimizes power losses, and leverages resonances to enable massive parallel computing in the frequency domain. The fabricated samples are compatible with silicon-on-insulator platforms and operate at single- and dual-frequency modes. The experimental setup demonstrates the ability to perform in situ training in both cases, validating the parallel-computing capabilities of the PICs. This work highlights the potential of feedback-loop PICs for scalable, compact, and energy-efficient linear optical computing."}

In this work, we investigate the interaction dynamics of two Neel-type skyrmions in an ultrathin ferromagnetic film through a combined analytical and numerical approach. Full micromagnetic simulations reveal that when the initial separation exceeds twice the skyrmion radius, the pair undergoes a repulsive interaction leading to an outward spiral trajectory whose radial and angular components depend sensitively on the Gilbert damping, consistent with particle-like models of skyrmion motion. The simulations further show a two-component oscillatory behaviour in the out-of-plane magnetization: a fast intrinsic breathing mode superimposed on a slower interaction-induced modulation. Using Thiele collective-coordinate model, an expression for the radial drift, angular decay, and logarithmic growth of the separation distance is derived. The analytical predictions show excellent agreement with numerical results, confirming the exponential form of the long-range interaction potential. A continuum micromagnetic analysis of the skyrmion tail explains the origin of the exponential decay and its role in governing the interaction strength. Together, these findings provide a unified framework for understanding spiral motion, breathing dynamics, and long-range repulsion in interacting skyrmion systems, offering insights relevant for multi-skyrmion information carriers and collective skyrmion-based devices."}

Existing design strategies generally lack complete control over reflectionless pathways and typically require computationally intensive iterative optimization. A general analytical framework for the inverse design of arbitrary reflectionless routing has remained unavailable. Here, we present an analytical inverse-design approach based on non-Hermitian zero-index networks, which enables arbitrary reflectionless routing for nearly any desired scattering response. By establishing a direct algebraic mapping between target scattering responses and the network's physical parameters, we transform the design process from iterative optimization into deterministic calculation. This approach enables the precise engineering of arbitrary reflectionless optical routing. We demonstrate its broad utility by designing devices from unicast and multicast routers with full amplitude and phase control to coherent beam combiners and spatial mode demultiplexers in four-port and six-port networks. Our work provides a systematic and analytical route to designing advanced light-control devices."}
