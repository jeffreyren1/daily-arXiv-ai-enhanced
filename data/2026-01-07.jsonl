However, the viscosity-density coupling effect often compromises accuracy in high-viscosity liquids. Although various decoupling strategies have been proposed, they often suffer from complexity and inefficiency. This study presents an AlN-based PMUT liquid density sensor insensitive to viscosity interference. The sensor employs two identical PMUTs, functioning as transmitter and receiver, respectively. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transmitter is reflected by the liquid surface and detected by the receiver. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that when the excitation frequency remains constant, the amplitude of the received electrical signal exhibits a specific relationship with liquid density, while the viscosity-induced signal amplitude variation becomes negligible. Therefore, after calibrating the PMUT liquid density sensor by fitting the relationship between received signal amplitude and density across 0-100% glycerol solutions, the device can measure densities within this range regardless of liquid type and viscosity. Experimental results show that the sensor can accurately measure the density of the propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula, with the calculated density error rate between measured propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula and actual densities remains below 0.125%, demonstrating measurement insensitivity to viscosity differences between the two liquids. The proposed method achieves maximum error rates of less than 2.5% in high-viscosity environments (80%-100% glycerol solutions), which is 20% that of other density measurement methods based on resonant frequency. The developed PMUT liquid density sensor exhibits a measurable density range from 0.789 to 1.261 g/cm3."}

We observe rotational dissipation times on the order of a few days. When a weak counteracting radiation-pressure torque is applied, the system unexpectedly stabilizes at a constant rotation rate that persists for about two days, constituting the mechanical analogue of injection locking.

While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level.

This, in turn, introduces a new tunable parameter $α$, which accounts for sensitivity to low- or high-probability events. Although RTE shows strong potential for analyzing causal relations in complex, non-Gaussian systems, its practical use is limited, primarily due to challenges related to its accurate estimation and interpretation. These difficulties are especially pronounced when working with finite, high-dimensional, or heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of a k-nearest neighbor estimator for both Rényi entropy (RE) and RTE using various synthetic data sets with clear cause-and-effect relationships inherent to their construction. We test the estimator across a broad range of parameters, including sample size, dimensionality, memory length, and Rényi order $α$. In particular, we apply the estimator to a set of simulated processes with increasing structural complexity, ranging from linear dynamics to nonlinear systems with multi-source couplings. To address interpretational challenges arising from potentially negative RE and RTE values, we introduce three reliability conditions and formulate practical guidelines for tuning the estimator parameters. We show that when the reliability conditions are met and the parameters are calibrated accordingly, the resulting effective RTE estimates accurately capture directional information flow across a broad range of scenarios. Results obtained show that the explanatory power of RTE depends sensitively on the choice of the Rényi parameter $α$. This highlights the usefulness of the RTE framework for identifying the drivers of extreme behavior in complex systems."}

The effects of particle diameter, charge rate, and pre-existing notches on the failure behaviour of Si particles were systematically analysed. The results showed that the increase in charge rate, particle diameter, and pre-existing notch length leads to larger cracking rates and faster fracturing of the particle. Then, a validated contour map of Si particle's fracture behaviours was developed. Additionally, the influence of pre-existing notch length and charge rate on fatigue damage was examined, and it was found that longer pre-existing notch length and larger charge rate can shorten the particle's cyclic life. Finally, to alleviate the particle fracture, nanopores were introduced in the particle, and the influence of porosity on the fracture behaviours was investigated. The results showed that nanopores can reduce expansion, dissipate global tensile stresses and elongate the crack propagation path.

For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology."}

The radar visibility of a road participant depends on its radar cross-section (RCS). While RCS is an inherent property, enhancing it, similar to using reflective vests for optical visibility, can significantly improve radar detection through cooperative target design. However, modern vehicles are not designed for this purpose, and embedded reflectors are not utilized due to the industry's conservative approach and the limited space available on the vehicle's exterior. Rear windshields offer a vast unused area, but they must still serve their primary function and remain transparent. We propose utilizing this area by embedding a reflecting surface that accounts for the interrogation scenario geometry and the angular tilt of the rear windshield, ensuring the wave is retroreflected back to the radar. The surface is realized as an array of thin conductive wires with a periodicity that provides in-phase excitation for the design incidence angle. Given that automotive radars operate in the millimeter-wave regime (77-81 GHz), large-scale surfaces with sub-millimeter manufacturing accuracy are required. This is achieved by imprinting conductive inks, composed of silver nanoparticles and binders, into grooves in the glass. The fabricated 10x10 sq. sm. sample, with around 90% optical transparency, demonstrates an RCS of 8 sq. m., surpassing the typical RCS of a car. Extrapolating this performance to the entire rear window with an embedded meta grating, a typical RCS of 1000 sq. m. can be achieved, thereby enhancing the detectability range by nearly an order of magnitude. Smart windows enable advanced applications in wireless communication, such as automotive scenarios, IoT, and many others."}

By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves.

The first technique is an extended integral equation (EIE) method, an extension of a previously developed EIE used to calculate the propagation constants in composite dielectric-isotropic waveguides. The second technique is a Chebyshev expansion method (CEM). In both implementations, the electric and magnetic fields in the gyrotropic core are expanded in superpotential-based cylindrical vector wave functions (SUPER-CVWFs), recently developed for the problem of oblique multiple scattering by gyrotropic cylinders. Both techniques allow us to calculate the propagation constants in the general case, without approximations. Various non-circular gyrotropic waveguides are considered. The EIE and CEM results are validated against a commercial finite element solver, and the accuracy and computational performance of both methods are benchmarked. A microwave application is presented where the complex propagation constants of ferrite rods are computed in the presence of an external magnetic flux density bias.

Micromagnetic simulations on voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic (FE/FM) heterostructures demonstrate that the comb spacing and spectral topology are determined solely by boundary kinematics, confirming direct Doppler phase coupling between boundary motion and spin-wave propagation. These results establish moving magnetic-energy boundaries as a new class of on-chip spectral synthesizers and define a coherent and energy-efficient framework for flexible tuning of magnonic frequencies, fundamentally distinct from traditional passive scattering or nonlinear multi-magnon mechanisms."}

However, capturing the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic field and of the mirror within a consistent theoretical framework remains challenging. We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution. This unified treatment highlights the connection between different dynamical regimes and provides a basis for analyzing applications ranging from precision interferometry to relativistic radiation-pressure effects."}

Here, we introduce a new concept based on the gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) technology that enables the synthesis of multiple independently tunable spectral lines with high pulse energy of >1 μJ and a few nanoseconds pulse width in the near- and mid-IR region. The number and wavelengths of the generated spectral lines can be dynamically reconfigured. A proof-of-concept laser beam synthesized of two narrow spectral lines at 3.99 μm and 4.25 μm wavelengths is demonstrated and combined with photoacoustic (PA) modality for real-time SO2 and CO2 detection.

Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters. Here, we overcome this constraint using a compact, acoustically powered device that provides optical excitation directly from within the target medium. By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination. We demonstrate this approach by imaging through a 12 cm thick phantom, establishing a pathway toward deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging."}

Lateral optical forces, which act perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation, are particularly intriguing but have largely been restricted to interface geometries such as air - water boundaries. Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a new mechanism for programmable, polarization-controlled optical manipulation, with promising implications for biophotonics, microfluidics, and active soft-matter systems."}

Recently, these two scenarios have been unified under a more general framework known as anyonic-PT symmetry, yet its physical implications in waveguide platforms and corresponding topological features in extended lattice systems remain largely unexplored. Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by π, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition. Moreover, in the symmetry-unbroken regime, the topological edge states emerge within the bulk gap and are protected by a generalized pseudo-anyonic-Hermiticity (PAH) symmetry. Our results establish anyonic-PT symmetry as a new tunable degree of freedom for non-Hermitian waveguide systems, where the eigenvalue argument provides a natural quantity for information encoding.

Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers. Experimentally, we observe compact edge states in laser-written photonic lattices with engineered rhombic-like unit cells, confirming their robustness against perturbations under both chiral symmetry and SubSy conditions.

We observed lasing at an emission wavelength of 870 nm for the single-mode PNL, with discrete voltage-dependent deflections of the far-field emission of up to $\\pm67$\\textdegree, while maintaining a beam divergence of less than 1\\textdegree. The steering characteristics were significantly influenced by the electro-optic properties of the LC layer, with an optimized thickness of 3 $μ$m. The structural periodicity governed the achievable angular separation and emission stability. Furthermore, we extended the concept to a dual-mode nanolaser based on a merged nanohole array (NHA), which supports two lasing wavelengths at 873 nm and 880 nm. Both lasing modes exhibited simultaneous voltage-dependent angular tuning without altering the cavity geometry.

Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one.

Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings.

THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $β$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz.
