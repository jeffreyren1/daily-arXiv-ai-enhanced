The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at https://github.com/kgandhi63/g4chargeit.git."}

The improved accuracy is achieved through a two-stage generation strategy, in which the first diffusion model is explicitly trained with Maxwells equation-based loss to embed physical insight directly into the inverse design process, while the second model maps the physically consistent intermediate representation to the final structural geometry with significantly higher fidelity than solely data-driven approaches. The performance of MxDiffusion is validated on two representative applications: gold nanostructures patterned on a silica substrate and a highly tunable bandpass filter based on phase change material. In both cases, the proposed framework consistently outperforms a conventional data-driven diffusion model benchmark, particularly for out-of-training-distribution design targets and highly constrained resonance conditions. These results demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of MxDiffusion as a general physics-guided inverse design paradigm."}

Here we realize a dual-channel self-referenced scheme enabled by two nearly degenerate quasinormal modes in a hybrid microcavity. Their shared optical path provides common-mode observables (i.e., overall spectral and intensity drift) that track global thermo-optic and pump fluctuations, while their differential-mode observables (i.e., spectral splitting and mode-contrasted emission) remain highly sensitive to local gap dielectric perturbations and dipole-dependent radiative weights. Using temperature as a control parameter in monolayer WSe$ _2 $, we exploit this common/differential-mode framework to robustly invert the relative populations of excitons with out-of-plane ($ \\perp $) and in-plane ($ \\parallel $) dipole transitions without external absolute calibration. At the temperature of $\\sim$50 K, we obtain $ N_\\perp/N_\\parallel \\approx 200 $, coincident with the expected accumulation in the out-of-plane-emitting dark manifold.

However, existing characterization frameworks are hindered by several limitations, most notably their inability to account for the polarization of the field. Here, we report polarization sensitive coherent modulation imaging (PS-CMI), a light-weight but robust, high-resolution platform for the full-field characterization of metasurface-modulated light. By supplementing the orthogonal x- and y- complex amplitude components with an additional 45°-component, this approach calculates the retardance between two orthogonal polarization components while eliminating phase offsets, thereby enabling the subsequent recovery of the complete polarization state. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by characterizing light fields produced by a United States Air Force (USAF) target, two kinds of complex polarization field, and a metalens. This compact solution addresses a critical gap in metasurface metrology and is broadly applicable to other fields requiring the mapping of complex, polarized light distributions."}

Motivated by the recent experimental realization of arbitrary fractional exponents, upon quantifying the tail properties of such coherent structures, we detail their destabilization when the fractional exponent $α$ acquires values $α<1$ and showcase how the relevant destabilization is associated with collapse type phenomena. We then turn to in- and out-of-phase pairs of such waveforms and illustrate how they generically exist for arbitrary $α$ when we cross the harmonic limit, i.e., for $α>2$. Importantly, we use the parameter $α$ as a ``bifurcation parameter'' in order to connect the harmonic ($α=2$) and biharmonic ($α=4$) limits. Remarkably, not only do we retrieve the instability of all solitonic pairs in the biharmonic case, but showcase a stabilization feature of particular branches of such multipulses that is {\\it unique} to the fractional case and does not arise -- to our knowledge -- for integer multi-pulse settings. We explain systematically this stabilization via spectral analysis and expand upon the implications of our results for the potential observability of fractional multipulse solitary waves."}

Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures."}

We investigate its consequences in the far-field regime in cylindrical cavities, by employing a specular ray-tracing algorithm. At thermal equilibrium, we show that violation of Kirchhoff's law yields non-vanishing heat rectification coefficients within different sections of the cavity, which can be tuned for perfect rectification and circulation, while internal monochromatic currents vanish due to the intrinsic coupling between emission and absorption at specular surfaces. This constraint is lifted under nonequilibrium conditions, where rotational heat fluxes within the cavity can be precisely controlled by appropriately combining reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials. These findings open new avenues for thermal management and provide design principles for nonreciprocal photonic devices."}

Here, we circumvent this limitation and demonstrate an all-optical mechanism for reconfiguring far-field singularities in a photonic crystal laser. The underlying principle involves optical pumping, which creates a mesoscopic potential landscape whose spatial variations are slow compared to the lattice period. Such a potential localizes a Bloch band into trapped states whose envelope functions, and thus far-field singularity textures, are defined by the pump geometry. Using a honeycomb photonic crystal that supports a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum, we achieve room-temperature telecom-band lasing with real-space polarisation singularities that are reconfigurable in both number and position, while the intrinsic momentum-space singularity at the $Γ$-point is preserved. The experimental observations align quantitatively with an analytical framework that combines the Bloch mode of the structure and envelope function theory, establishing envelope engineering as a versatile route to programmable singular-light emission in active photonic lattices."}

In recent years, this paradigm has evolved from a classical description of radiation and acceleration toward a fully quantum framework, transforming our understanding of light-matter interactions at the single-electron level. These advances have opened new opportunities in high-resolution imaging, ultrafast spectroscopy, interferometry, and the coherent shaping of electron wavepackets. This review surveys stimulated interactions between slow electrons and light, encompassing free-space and near-field mediated mechanisms. We discuss how free-space optical fields coherently modulate electron momentum and energy, and how near-field coupling in nanophotonic and plasmonic structures enables strong, phase-matched, efficient momentum exchange with the electron wavepacket. We further describe electron recoil, which is significant in the slow-electron regime, and temporal and spatial wavepacket shaping that enhances coupling efficiency and extends access to quantum-coherent regimes. Building on these foundations, we outline emerging frameworks including hybrid optical-electrostatic modulation, ponderomotive laser-based aberration correction, and optical electron interferometry. By unifying these developments, stimulated electron-light interactions provide a versatile route to precise beam control, quantum-state engineering, and tailored light-matter coupling, with implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nanoscale metrology, attosecond pulse generation, electron-photon entanglement, and the creation of nonclassical states of light."}

Proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop transformer framework for phase-only far-field holography", "summary": "Phase-only computer-generated holography (CGH) seeks a phase pattern for a spatial light modulator (SLM) whose propagated optical field reproduces a desired intensity distribution. In the far-field (Fraunhofer) regime, optical propagation reduces to a Fourier transform, such that each hologram pixel contributes to the entire reconstructed intensity distribution. When restricted to phase-only modulation, intensity must be shaped through global phase interference effects, making the inverse mapping from target intensity to phase highly non-linear and sensitive to local minima. We present a proof-of-concept physics-in-the-loop approach in which a transformer maps a target intensity image to a phase-only SLM field and is trained end-to-end through exact FFT-based propagation embedded directly within optimization. We further observe that patch tokenization strongly shapes the optimization geometry: coarse tokenization acts as an implicit spectral regularizer that stabilizes training and suppresses checkerboard-like attractors, while finer tokenization increases spatial degrees of freedom but benefits from curriculum or hierarchical refinement. Despite training on limited primitives and restricted digit subsets, the learned generator exhibits out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to unseen digits and hand-drawn target patterns. These results suggest that transformer architectures, whose self-attention enables global token interactions, are a natural fit for far-field holography and provide a viable foundation for scalable physics-grounded hologram generation."}
